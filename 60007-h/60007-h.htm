  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the following pages it has been my object to give a systematic
    account of various Earth Movements.</p>

  <p>These comprise <em>Earthquakes</em>, or the sudden violent movements of the
    ground; <em>Earth Tremors</em>, or minute movements which escape our attention
    by the smallness of their amplitude; <em>Earth Pulsations</em>, or movements
    which are overlooked on account of the length of their period; and
    lastly, <em>Earth Oscillations</em>, or movements of long period and large
    amplitude which attract so much attention from their geological
    importance.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to separate these Earth Movements from each other,
    because they are phenomena which only differ in degree, and which are
    intimately associated in their occurrence and in their origin.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>Because Earthquakes are phenomena which have attracted a universal
    attention since the earliest times, and about them so many observations
    have been made, they are treated of at considerable length.</p>

  <p>As very much of what might be said about the other Earth Movements is
    common to what is said about Earthquakes,
    <span class="pagenum">vi</span>it has been possible to make
    the description of these phenomena comparatively short.</p>

  <p>The scheme which has been adopted will be understood from the following
    table:—</p>

  <p class="noindent">In some instances the grouping of phenomena according to the above
    scheme may be found inaccurate, as, for example, in the chapters
    referring to the effects and causes of Earthquakes.</p>

  <p>This arises from the fact that the relationship between Earthquakes
    and other Earth phenomena are not well understood. Thus the sudden
    elevation of a coast line and an accompanying earthquake may be
    related, either as effect and cause, or <i xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>, or they may both
    be the effect of a third phenomenon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">vii</span></p>

  <p>Much of what is said respecting Earthquake motion will show how little
    accurate knowledge we have about these disturbances. Had I been writing
    in England, and, therefore, been in a position to make references to
    libraries and persons who are authorities on subjects connected with
    Seismology, the following pages might have been made more complete,
    and inaccuracies avoided. A large proportion of the material embodied
    in the following pages is founded on experiments and observations
    made during an eight years’ residence in Japan, where I have had the
    opportunity of recording an earthquake every week.</p>

  <p>The writer to whom I am chiefly indebted is Mr. Robert Mallet. Not
    being in a position to refer to original memoirs, I have drawn many
    illustrations from the works of Professor Karl Fuchs and M. S. di
    Rossi. These, and other writers to whom reference has been made, are
    given in an appendix.</p>

  <p>For seeing these pages through the press, my thanks are due to
    Mr. Thomas Gray, who, when residing in Japan, did so much for the
    advancement of observational Seismology.</p>

  <p>For advice and assistance in devising experiments, I tender my thanks
    to my colleagues, Professor T. Alexander, Mr. T. Fujioka, and to my
    late colleague. Professor John Perry.</p>

  <p>For assistance in the actual observation of Earthquakes, I have to
    thank my friends in various parts of Japan, especially Mr. J. Bissett
    and Mr. T. Talbot, of Yokohama. For assistance in obtaining information
    from<span class="pagenum">viii</span>
    Italian sources I have to thank Dr. F. Du Bois, from German
    sources Professor C. Netto, and from Japanese sources Mr. B. H.
    Chamberlain. For help in carrying out experiments, I am indebted to
    the liberality of the British Association, the Geological Society of
    London, the Meteorological and Telegraph departments of Japan, and to
    the officers of my own institution, the Imperial College of Engineering.</p>

  <p>And, lastly, I offer my sincere thanks to those gentlemen who have
    taken part in the establishment and working of the Seismological
    Society of Japan, and to my publishers, whose liberality has enabled me
    to place the labours of residents in the Far East before the European
    public.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span>
    bygone superstitious times lightning and thunder were regarded
    as supernatural visitations. But as these phenomena became better
    understood, and men learned how to avoid their destructive power, the
    superstition was gradually dispelled. Thus it is with Earthquakes:
    the more clearly they are understood, the more confident in the
    universality of law will man become, and the more will his mental
    condition be advanced.</p>

  <p>In his ‘History of Civilisation in England,’ Buckle has laid
    considerable stress upon the manner in which earthquakes, volcanoes,
    and other of the more terrible forms in which the workings of
    nature reveal themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
    to us, have exerted an influence upon the
    imagination and understanding; and just as a sudden fright may affect
    the nerves of a child for the remainder of its life, we have in the
    annals of seismology records which indicate that earthquakes have not
    been without a serious influence upon the mental condition of whole
    communities.</p>

  <p>To a geologist there are perhaps no phenomena in nature more
    interesting than earthquakes, the study of which is called Seismology.
    Coming, as shocks often will, from a region of volcanoes, the study
    of these disturbances may enable us to understand something about
    the nature and working of a volcano. As an earthquake wave travels
    along from strata to strata, if we study its reflections and changing
    velocity in transit, we may often be led to the discovery of certain
    rocky structures buried deep beneath our view, about which, without the
    help of such waves, it would be hopeless ever to attain any knowledge.</p>

  <p>By studying the propagation of earthquake waves the physicist is
    enabled to confirm his speculations respecting the transmission of
    disturbances in elastic media. For the physicist earthquakes are
    gigantic experiments which tell him the elastic moduli of rocks as
    they exist in nature, and when properly interpreted may lead him to
    the proper comprehension of many ill-understood phenomena. It is not
    impossible that seismological investigation may teach us something
    about the earth’s magnetism, and the connection between earthquakes and
    the ‘earth currents’ which appear in our telegraph wires. These and
    numerous other kindred problems fall within the domain of the physicist.</p>

  <p>It is of interest to the meteorologist to know the connections which
    probably exist between earthquakes and the fluctuations of the
    barometer, the changes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
    thermometer, the quantity of rainfall,
    and like phenomena to which he devotes his attention.</p>

  <p>Next we may turn to the more practical aims of seismology and ask
    ourselves what are the effects of earthquakes upon buildings, and
    how, in earthquake-shaken countries, the buildings are to be made to
    withstand them. Here we are face to face with problems which demand
    the attention of engineers and builders. To attain what we desire,
    observation, common sense, and subtle reasoning must be brought to bear
    upon this subject.</p>

  <p>In the investigation of the principle on which earthquake instruments
    make their records, in the analysis of the results they give, in
    problems connected with astronomy, with physics, and with construction,
    seismology offers to the mathematician new fields for investigation.</p>

  <p>A study of the effects which earthquakes produce on the lower animals
    will not fail to interest the student of natural history.</p>

  <p>A study like seismology, which leads us to a more complete knowledge
    of earth-heat and its workings, is to be regarded as one of the
    corner-stones of geology. The science of seismology invites the
    co-operation of workers and thinkers in almost every department of
    natural science.</p>

  <p>We have already referred to the influence exerted by earthquakes over
    the human mind. How to predict earthquakes, and how to escape from
    their dangers, are problems which, if they can be solved, are of
    extreme interest to the world at large.</p>

  <p>In addition to the sudden and violent movements which we call
    earthquakes, the seismologist has to investigate the smaller motions
    which we call earth tremors. From observations which have been made
    of late years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    it would appear that the ground on which we dwell is
    incessantly in a state of tremulous motion.</p>

  <p>A further subject of investigation which is before the seismologist is
    the experimental verification of the existence of what may be called
    ‘earth-pulsations.’ These are motions which mathematical physicists
    affirmed the existence of, but which, in consequence of the slowness of
    their period, have hitherto escaped observation.</p>

  <p>The oscillations, or slow changes in the relative positions of land and
    sea, might also be included; but this has already been taken up as a
    separate branch of geology.</p>

  <p>These four classes of movements are no doubt interdependent, and
    seismology in the widest sense might conveniently be employed to
    include them all. In succeeding chapters we will endeavour to indicate
    how far the first three of these branches have been prosecuted, and
    to point out that which remains to be accomplished. It is difficult,
    however, to form a just estimate of the amount of seismological work
    which has been done, in consequence of the scattered and uncertain
    nature of many of the records. Seismology, as a science, originated
    late, chiefly owing to the facts that centres of civilisation are
    seldom in the most disturbed regions, and that earthquake-shaken
    countries are widely separated from each other.</p>

  <p>As every portion of the habitable globe appears to have been shaken
    more or less by earthquakes, and as these phenomena are so terrible in
    their nature, we can readily understand why seismological literature is
    extensive. In the annals of almost every country which has a written
    history, references are made to seismic disturbances.</p>

  <p>An idea of the attention which earthquakes have received may be
    gathered from the fact that Professor Alexis Perrey, of Dijon, who
    has published some sixty memoirs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
    on this subject, gave, in 1856, a
    catalogue of 1,837 works devoted to seismology.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
    In 1858 Mr. Robert
    Mallet published in the Reports of the British Association a list of
    several hundred works relating to earthquakes. Sixty-five of these
    works are to be found in the British Museum. So far as literature is
    concerned, earthquakes have received as much attention in the East as
    in the West. In China there are many works treating on earthquakes, and
    the attention which these phenomena received may be judged of from the
    fact that in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 136 the Government appointed a commission
    to inquire into the subject. Even the isolated empire of Japan can
    boast of at least sixty-five works on earthquakes, seven of which
    are earthquake calendars, and twenty-three earthquake monographs.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
    Besides those treating especially of earthquakes, there are innumerable
    references to such disturbances in various histories, in the
    transactions of learned societies, and in periodicals. To attempt to
    give a complete catalogue of even the books which have been written
    would be to enter on a work of compilation which would occupy many
    years, and could never be satisfactorily finished.</p>

  <p>In the ‘Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,’ which were
    issued in the eighteenth century, there are about one hundred and
    eighty separate communications on earthquakes; and in the ‘Gentleman’s
    Magazine’ for 1755 there are no less than fifty notes and articles on
    the same subject. The great interest shown in earthquakes about the
    years 1750–60 in England, was chiefly due to the terrible calamity
    which overtook Lisbon in 1755, and to the fact that about this time
    several shocks were experienced in various parts of the British
    Islands. In 1750, which may <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
    be described as the earthquake year of
    Britain, ‘a shock was felt in Surrey on March 14; on the 18th of the
    same month the whole of the south-west of England was disturbed. On
    April 2, Chester was shaken; on June 7, Norwich was disturbed; on
    August 23, the inhabitants of Lancashire were alarmed; and on September
    30 ludicrous and alarming scenes occurred in consequence of a shock
    having been felt during the hours of Divine service, causing the
    congregations to hurry into the open air.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
    As might be expected,
    these occurrences gave rise to many articles and notes directing
    attention to the subject of earthquakes.</p>

  <p>Seismic literature has not, however, at all times been a measure of
    seismic activity: thus, in Japan, the earthquake records for the
    twelfth and sixteenth centuries scarcely mention any shocks. At first
    sight it might be imagined that this was owing to an absence of
    earthquakes; but it is sufficiently accounted for by the fact that
    at that time the country was torn with civil war, and matters more
    urgent than the recording of natural phenomena engaged the attention of
    the inhabitants. Professor Rockwood, who has given so much attention
    to seismic disturbances in America, tells us that during the recent
    contest between Chili and Peru a similar intermission is observable. We
    see, therefore, that an absence of records does not necessarily imply
    an absence of the phenomena to be recorded.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the earliest existing records of earthquakes are those which
    occur in the Bible. The first of these, which we are told occurred in
    Palestine, was in the reign of Ahab (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 918–897).<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
    One of the most terrible earthquakes mentioned in the Bible is that which took
    place in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 811–759),
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
    which shook the ground and rent the Temple. The awful character of
    this, and the deep impression produced on men’s minds, may be learned
    from the fact that the time of its occurrence was subsequently used as
    an epoch from which to reckon dates.</p>

  <p>The writings of Herodotus, Pliny, Livy, &amp;c., &amp;c., show the interest
    which earthquakes attracted in early ages. These writers chiefly
    devoted themselves to references and descriptions of disastrous shocks,
    and to theories respecting the cause of earthquakes.</p>

  <p>The greater portion of the Japanese notices of earthquakes is simply
    a series of anecdotes of events which took place at the time of
    these disasters. We also find references to superstitious beliefs,
    curious occurrences, and the apparent connection between earthquake
    disturbances and other natural phenomena. In these respects the
    literature of the East closely resembles that of the West. The
    earthquake calendars of the East, however, form a class of books which
    can hardly be said to find their parallel in Europe;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> while, on the
    other hand, the latter possesses types of books and pamphlets which do
    not appear to have a parallel elsewhere. These are the more or less
    theological works—‘Moral Reflections on Earthquakes,’ ‘Sermons’ which
    have been preached on earthquakes, ‘Prayers’ which have been appointed
    to be read.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>Speaking generally, it may be said that the writings of the ancients,
    and those of the Middle Ages, down to the commencement of the
    nineteenth century, tended to the propagation of superstition and to
    theories based on speculations with few and imperfect facts for their
    foundation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

  <p>Among the efforts which have been made in modern times to raise
    seismology to a higher level, is that of Professor Perrey, of Dijon,
    who commenced in 1840 a series of extensive catalogues embracing
    the earthquakes of the world. These catalogues enabled Perrey, and
    subsequently Mallet in his reports to the British Association, to
    discuss the periodicity of earthquakes, with reference to the seasons
    and to other phenomena, in a more general manner than it had been
    possible for previous workers to accomplish. The facts thus accumulated
    also enabled Mallet to discuss earthquakes in general, and the various
    phenomena which they present were sifted and classified for inspection.
    Another great impetus which observational seismology received was Mr.
    Mallet’s report upon the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857, in which new
    methods of seismic investigation were put forth. These have formed
    the working tools of many subsequent observers, and by them, as well
    as by his experiments on artificially produced disturbances, Mallet
    finally drew the study of earthquakes from the realms of speculation by
    showing that they, like other natural phenomena, were capable of being
    understood and investigated.</p>

  <p>In addition to Perrey and Mallet, the nineteenth century has produced
    many writers who have taken a considerable share in the advancement of
    seismology. There are the catalogues of Von Hoff, the observations of
    Humboldt, the theoretical investigations of Hopkins, the monographs of
    Schmidt, Seebach, Lasaulx, and others; the books of Fuchs, Credner,
    Vogt, Volger; the records and observations of Palmieri, Bertelli,
    Rossi, and other Italian observers. To these, which are only a few
    out of a long list of names, may be added the publications of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
    Commission appointed for the observation of earthquakes by the Natural
    History Society of Switzerland, and the volumes which have been
    published by the Seismological Society of Japan.</p>

  <p>Before concluding this chapter it will be well to define a few of the
    more ordinary terms which are used in describing earthquake phenomena.
    It may be observed that the English word <em>earthquake</em>, the German
    <i xml:lang="de">erdbeben</i>, the French <i xml:lang="fr">tremblement de terre</i>, the Spanish <i xml:lang="es">terremoto</i>,
    the Japanese <i xml:lang="ja">jishin</i> &amp;c., all mean, when literally translated,
    <em>earth-shaking</em>, and are popularly understood to mean a sudden and more
    or less violent disturbance.</p>

  <p>Seismology (σειμός an earthquake, λόγος a discourse)
    in its simplest sense means the study of earthquakes. To be consistent
    with a Greek basis for seismological terminology, some writers have
    thrown aside the familiar expression ‘earthquake,’ and substituted the
    awkward word ‘seism.’</p>

  <p>The source from which an earthquake originates is called the ‘origin,’
    ‘focal cavity,’ or ‘centrum.’</p>

  <p>The point or area on the surface of the ground above the origin is
    called the ‘epicentrum.’ The line joining the centrum and epicentrum is
    called the ‘seismic vertical.’</p>

  <p>The radial lines along which an earthquake may be propagated from the
    centrum are called ‘wave paths.’</p>

  <p>The angle which a wave path, where it reaches the surface of the earth,
    makes with that surface is called the ‘angle of emergence’ of the wave.
    This angle is usually denoted by the letter <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p>As the result of a simple explosion at a point in a homogeneous medium,
    we ought, theoretically, to obtain at points on the surface of the
    medium equidistant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
    from the epicentrum, equal mechanical effects.
    These points will lie on circles called ‘isoseismic’ or ‘coseismic’
    circles. The area included between two such circles is an ‘isoseismic
    area.’ In nature, however, isoseismic lines are seldom circles.
    Elliptical or irregular curves are the common forms.</p>

  <p>The isoseismic area in which the greatest disturbance has taken place
    is called the ‘meizoseismic area.’ Seebach calls the lines enclosing
    this area ‘pleistoseists.’</p>

  <p>These last-mentioned lines are wholly due to Mallet and Seebach.</p>

  <p>Many words are used to distinguish different kinds of earthquakes from
    each other. All of these appear to be very indefinite and to depend
    upon the observer’s feelings, which, in turn, depend upon his nervous
    temperament and his situation.</p>

  <p>In South America small earthquakes, consisting of a series of rapidly
    recurring vibratory movements not sufficiently powerful to create
    damage, are spoken of as <i xml:lang="es">trembelores</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i xml:lang="es">terremotos</i> of South America are earthquakes of a destructive
    nature, in which distinct shocks are perceptible. It may be observed
    that shocks which at one place would be described as <i xml:lang="es">terremoto</i>
    would at another and more distant place probably be described as
    <i xml:lang="es">trembelores</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i xml:lang="es">succussatore</i> are the shocks where there is considerable vertical
    motion. The terrible shock of Riobamba (February 4, 1797), which is
    said to have thrown corpses from their graves to a height of 100 feet,
    was an earthquake of this order.</p>

  <p>The <i xml:lang="es">vorticosi</i> are shocks which have a twisting or rotatory motion.</p>

  <p>Another method of describing earthquakes would be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> to refer to
    instrumental records. When the vibrations of the ground have only
    been along the line joining the observer and the epicentrum, the
    disturbance might be called ‘euthutropic.’ A disturbance in which the
    prominent movements are <em>transverse</em> to the above direction might be
    called ‘diagonic.’ If motions in both of these directions occur in the
    records, the shock might be said to be ‘diastrophic.’ If there be much
    vertical movement, the shock might be said to be ‘anaseismic.’ Some
    disturbances could only be described by using two or three of these
    terms.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Before</span>
    we discuss the nature of earthquake motion, the determination
    of which has been the aim of modern seismological investigation, the
    reader will naturally look for an account of the various instruments
    which have been employed for recording such disturbances. A description
    of the earthquake machines which have been used even in Japan would
    form a bulky volume. All that we can do, therefore, is to describe
    briefly the more prominent features of a few of the more important of
    these instruments. In order that the relative merits of these may be
    better understood, we may state generally that modern research has
    shown a typical earthquake to consist of a series of small tremors
    succeeded by a shock, or series of shocks, separated by more or less
    irregular vibrations of the ground. The vibrations are often both
    irregular in period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
    and in amplitude, and they have a duration of from
    a few seconds to several minutes. We will illustrate the records of
    actual earthquakes in a future chapter, but in the meantime the idea
    that an earthquake consists of a single shock must be dismissed from
    the imagination.</p>

  <p>To construct an instrument which at the time of an earthquake shall
    move and leave a record of its motion, there is but little difficulty.
    Contrivances of this order are called <em>seismoscopes</em>. If, however,
    we wish to know the period, extent, and direction of each of the
    vibrations which constitutes an earthquake, we have considerable
    difficulty. Instruments which will in this way measure or write down
    the earth’s motions are called <em>seismometers</em> or <em>seismographs</em>.</p>

  <p>Many of the elaborate instruments supplemented with electro-magnetic
    and clockwork arrangements are, when we examine them, nothing more than
    elaborate seismoscopes which have been erroneously termed seismographs.</p>

  <p>The only approximations to true seismographs which have yet been
    invented are without doubt those which during the past few years have
    been used in Japan. It would be a somewhat arbitrary proceeding,
    however, to classify the different instruments as seismoscopes,
    seismometers, and seismographs, as the character of the record given
    by certain instruments is sometimes only seismoscopic, whilst at other
    times it is seismometric, depending on the nature of the disturbance.
    Many instruments, for instance, would record with considerable accuracy
    a single sudden movement, but would give no reliable information
    regarding a continued shaking.</p>

  <p><em>Eastern Seismoscopes.</em>—The earliest seismoscope of which we find any
    historical record is one which owes its origin to a Chinese called
    Chôko. It was invented in the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 136. A description is
    given in the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
    history called ‘Gokanjo,’ and the translation of
    this description runs as follows:—</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p014.jpg" width="400" height="473" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>‘In the first year of Yōka, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 136, a Chinese called Chôko
    invented the seismometer shown in the accompanying drawing. This
    instrument consists of a spherically formed copper vessel, the diameter
    of which is eight feet. It is covered at its top, and in form resembles
    a wine-bottle. Its outer part is ornamented by the figures of different
    kinds of birds and animals, and old peculiar-looking letters. In the
    inner part of this instrument a column is so suspended that it can
    move in eight directions. Also, in the inside of the bottle, there is
    an arrangement by which some record of an earthquake is made according
    to the movement of the pillar. On the outside of the bottle there
    are eight dragon heads, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
    of which holds a ball in its mouth.
    Underneath these heads there are eight frogs so placed that they appear
    to watch the dragon’s face, so that they are ready to receive the ball
    if it should be dropped. All the arrangements which cause the pillar to
    knock the ball out of the dragon’s mouth are well hidden in the bottle.’</p>

  <p>‘When an earthquake occurs, and the bottle is shaken, the dragon
    instantly drops the ball, and the frog which receives it vibrates
    vigorously; any one watching this instrument can easily observe
    earthquakes.’</p>

  <p>With this arrangement, although one dragon may drop a ball, it is
    not necessary for the other seven dragons to drop their balls unless
    the movement has been in all directions; thus we can easily tell the
    direction of an earthquake.</p>

  <p>‘Once upon a time a dragon dropped its ball without any earthquake
    being observed, and the people therefore thought the instrument of
    no use, but after two or three days a notice came saying that an
    earthquake had taken place at Rōsei. Hearing of this, those who doubted
    the use of this instrument began to believe in it again. After this
    ingenious instrument had been invented by Chōko, the Chinese Government
    wisely appointed a secretary to make observations on earthquakes.’</p>

  <p>Not only is this instrument of interest on account of its antiquity,
    but it is also of interest on account of the close resemblance it bears
    to many of the instruments of modern times.</p>

  <p>Another earthquake instrument also of Eastern origin is the magnetic
    seismoscope of Japan.</p>

  <p>On the night of the destructive earthquake of 1855, which devastated
    a great portion of Tokio, the owner of a spectacle shop in Asakusa
    observed that a magnet dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
    some old iron nails and keys which had
    been attached to it. From this occurrence the owner thought that the
    magnet had, in consequence of its age, lost its powers. About two hours
    afterwards, however, the great earthquake took place, after which the
    magnet was observed to have regained its powers. This occurrence led
    to the construction of the seismoscope, which is illustrated in a book
    called the ‘Ansei-Kembun-Roku,’ or a description of the earthquake of
    1855, and examples of the instrument are still to be seen in Tokio.
    These instruments consist of a piece of magnetic iron ore, which holds
    up a piece of iron like a nail. This nail is connected, by means of a
    string, with a train of clockwork communicating with an alarm. If the
    nail falls a catch is released and the clockwork set in motion, and
    warning given by the ringing of a bell. It does not appear that this
    instrument has ever acted with success.</p>

  <p><em>Columns.</em>—One of the commonest forms of seismoscope, and one which
    has been very widely used, consists of a round column of wood, metal,
    or other suitable material, placed, with its axis vertical, on a level
    plane, and surrounded by some soft material such as loose sand to
    prevent it rolling should it be overturned. The fall of such a column
    indicates that a shaking or shock has taken place. Attempts have been
    made by using a number of columns of different sizes to make these
    indications seismometric, but they seldom give reliable information
    either as to intensity or direction of shock. The indications as to
    intensity are vitiated by the fact that a long-continued gentle shaking
    may overturn a column which would stand a very considerable sudden
    shock, while the directions in which a number of columns fall seldom
    agree owing to the rotational motion imparted to them by the shaking.
    Besides, the direction of motion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
    of the earthquake seldom remains in
    the same azimuth throughout the whole disturbance.</p>

  <p>An extremely delicate, and at the same time simple form of seismoscope
    may be made by propping up strips of glass, pins, or other easily
    overturned bodies against suitably placed supports. In this way bodies
    may be arranged, which, although they can only fall in one direction,
    nevertheless fall with far less motion than is necessary to overturn
    any column which will stand without lateral support.</p>

  <p><em>Projection Seismometers.</em>—Closely related to the seismoscopes and
    seismometers which depend on the overturning of bodies. Mallet has
    described two sets of apparatus whose indications depend on the
    distance to which a body is projected. In one of these, which consisted
    of two similar parts arranged at right angles, two metal balls rest one
    on each side of a stop at the lower part of two inclined
    <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/i_p017.png" alt="" width="48" height="25" />
    like troughs. In this position each of the balls completes an electric
    circuit. By a shock the balls are projected or rolled up the troughs,
    and the height to which they rise is recorded by a corresponding
    interval in the break of the circuits. The vertical component of the
    motion is measured by the compression of a spring which carries the
    table on which this arrangement rests. In the second apparatus two
    balls are successively projected, one by the forward swing, and the
    other by the backward swing of the shock. Attached to them are loose
    wires forming terminals of the circuits. They are caught in a bed
    of wet sand in a metal trough forming the other end of the circuit.
    The throw of the balls as measured in the sand, and the difference
    of time between their successive projections as indicated by special
    contrivances connected with the closing of the circuits, enables
    the observer to calculate the direction of the wave of shock,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> its
    velocity, and other elements connected with the disturbance. It will be
    observed that the design of this apparatus assumes the earthquake to
    consist of a distinct isolated shock.</p>

  <p>Oldham, at the end of his account of the Cachar earthquake of 1869,
    recommends the use of an instrument based on similar principles. In his
    instrument four balls like bullets are placed in notches cut in the
    corners of the upper end of a square stake driven into the ground.</p>

  <p><em>Vessels filled with liquid.</em>—Another form of simple seismoscope is
    made by partially filling a vessel with liquid. The height to which the
    liquid is washed up the side of the vessel is taken as an indication of
    the intensity of the shock, and the line joining the points on which
    maximum motion is indicated, is taken as the direction of the shock. If
    earthquakes all lasted for the same length of time, and consisted of
    vibrations of the same period, such instruments might be of service.
    These instruments have, however, been in use from an early date. In
    1742 we find that bowls of water were used to measure the earthquakes
    which in that year alarmed the inhabitants of Leghorn. About the same
    time the Rev. S. Chandler, writing about the shock at Lisbon, tells us
    that earthquakes may be measured by means of a spherical bowl about
    three or four feet in diameter, the inside of which, after being dusted
    over with Barber’s puff, is filled very gently with water. Mallet,
    Babbage, and De la Bêche have recommended the same sort of contrivance,
    but, notwithstanding, it has justly been criticised as ‘ridiculous and
    utterly impracticable.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

  <p>An important portion of Palmieri’s well-known instrument consists
    of horizontal tubes turned up at the ends and partially filled with
    mercury. To magnify the motion of the mercury, small floats of iron
    rest on its surface. These are attached by means of threads to a pulley
    provided with indices which move in front of a scale of degrees. We
    thus read off the intensity of an earthquake as so many degrees, which
    means so many millimetres of washing up and down of mercury in a tube.
    The direction of movement is determined by the azimuth of the tube
    which gives the maximum indication, several tubes being placed in
    different azimuths.</p>

  <p>This form of instrument appears to have been suggested by Mallet, who
    gives an account of the same in 1846. Inasmuch as the rise and fall
    of the mercury in such tubes depend on its depth and on the period
    of the earthquake together with its duration, we see that although
    the results obtained from a given instrument may give us means of
    making approximate comparisons as to the relative intensity of various
    earthquakes, it is very far from yielding any absolute measurement.</p>

  <p>Another method which has been employed to magnify and register the
    motions of liquid in a vessel has been to float upon its surface a
    raft or ship from which a tall mast projected. By a slight motion of
    the raft, the top of the mast vibrated through a considerable range.
    This motion of the mast as to direction and extent was then recorded by
    suitable contrivances attached to the top of the mast.</p>

  <p>A very simple form of liquid seismoscope consists of a circular trough
    of wood with notches cut round its side. This is filled with mercury
    to the level of the notches. At the time of an earthquake the maximum
    quantity of mercury runs over the notches in the direction of greatest
    motion. This instrument, which has long been used in Italy, is known as
    a Cacciatore, being named after its inventor. It is a prominent feature
    in the collection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
    of apparatus forming the well-known seismograph of Palmieri.</p>

  <p><em>Pendulum instruments.</em>—Mallet speaks of pendulum seismoscopes and
    seismographs as ‘the oldest probably of seismometers long set up in
    Italy and southern Europe.’ In 1841 we find these being used to record
    the earthquake disturbances at Comrie in Scotland.</p>

  <p>These instruments may be divided into two classes: first, those which
    at the time of the shock are intended to swing, and thus record the
    direction of movement; and second, those which are supposed to remain
    at rest and thus provide ‘steady points.’</p>

  <p>To obtain an absolutely ‘steady point’ at the time of an earthquake,
    has been one of the chief aims of all recent seismological
    investigations.</p>

  <p>With a style or pointer projecting down from the steady point to
    a surface which is being moved backward and forward by the earth,
    such a surface has written upon it by its own motions a record of
    the ground to which it is attached. Conversely, a point projecting
    upwards from the moving earth might be caused to write a record on the
    body providing the steady point, which in the class of instruments
    now to be referred to is supposed to be the bob of a pendulum. It is
    not difficult to get a pendulum which will swing at the time of a
    moderately strong earthquake, but it is somewhat difficult to obtain
    one which will not swing at such a time. During the past few years,
    pendulums varying between forty feet in length and carrying bobs of
    eighty pounds in weight, and one-eighth of an inch in length, and
    carrying a gun-shot, have been experimented with under a great variety
    of circumstances. Sometimes the supports of these pendulums have been
    as rigid as it is possible to make a structure from brick and mortar,
    and at other times they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
    intentionally been made loose and
    flexible. The indices which wrote the motions of these pendulums have
    been as various as the pendulums themselves. A small needle sliding
    vertically through two small holes, and resting its lower end on a
    surface of smoked glass, has on account of its small amount of friction
    been perhaps one of the favourite forms of recording pointers.</p>

  <p>The free pendulums which have been employed, and which were intended
    to swing, have been used for two purposes: first, to determine the
    direction of motion from the direction of swing, and second, to see if
    an approximation to the period of the earth’s motion could be obtained
    by discovering the pendulum amongst a series of different lengths which
    was set in most violent motion, this probably being the one which had
    its natural period of swing the most nearly approximating to the period
    of the earthquake oscillations.</p>

  <p>Inasmuch as all pendulums when swinging have a tendency to change the
    plane of their oscillation, and also as we now know that the direction
    of motion during an earthquake is not always constant, the results
    usually obtained with these instruments respecting the direction of
    the earth’s motion have been unsatisfactory. The results which were
    obtained by series of pendulums of different lengths were, for various
    reasons, also unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>Of pendulums intended to provide a steady point, from which the
    relative motion of a point on the earth’s surface could be recorded,
    there has been a great variety. One of the oldest forms consisted of
    a pendulum with a style projecting downwards from the bob so as to
    touch a bed of sand. Sometimes a concave surface was placed beneath the
    pendulum, on which the record was traced by means of a pencil. Probably
    the best form was that in which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
    needle, capable of sliding freely up
    and down, marked the relative horizontal motion of the earth and the
    pendulum bob on a smoked glass plate.</p>

  <p>It generally happens that at the time of a moderately severe earthquake
    the whole of these forms of apparatus are set in motion, due partly to
    the motion of the point of support of the pendulum, and partly to the
    friction of the writing point on the plate.</p>

  <p>Among these pendulums may be mentioned those of Cavallieri, Faura,
    Palmieri, Rossi, and numerous others. It is possible that the
    originators of some of these pendulums may have intended that
    they should record by swinging. If this is so, then so far as the
    determination of the actual nature of earthquake motion is concerned,
    they belong to a lower grade of apparatus than that in which they are
    here included.</p>

  <p>A great improvement in pendulum apparatus is due to Mr. Thomas Gray
    of Glasgow, who suggested applying so much frictional resistance to
    the free swing of a pendulum that for small displacements it became
    ‘dead beat.’ By carrying out this suggestion, pendulum instruments
    were raised to the position of seismographs. The manner of applying
    the friction will be understood from the following description of a
    pendulum instrument which is also provided with an index which gives a
    magnification of the motion of the earth.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">b b b b</span> is a box 113 cm. high and 30 cm. by 18 cm. square.
    Inside this box a lead ring <span class="smcap">r</span>, 17 cm. in diameter and 3 cm.
    thick, is suspended as a pendulum from the screw <span class="smcap">s</span>. This screw
    passes through a small brass plate <span class="smcap">p p</span>, which can be moved
    horizontally over a hole in the top of the box. These motions in the
    point of suspension allow the pendulum to be adjusted.</p>

  <div class="figright">
    <img src="images/i_p023.jpg" width="300" height="539" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>Projecting over the top of the pendulum there is a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> wooden arm
    <span class="smcap">w</span> carrying two sliding pointers <span class="smcap">h h</span>, resting
    on a glass plate placed on the top of the pendulum. These pointers are
    for the purpose of giving the frictional resistance before referred to.
    If this friction plate is smoked, the friction pointers will write upon
    it records of <em>large</em> earthquakes independently of the records given
    by the proper index, which only gives satisfactory records in the case
    of shocks of ordinary intensity. Crossing the inside of the pendulum
    <span class="smcap">r</span> there is a brass bar perforated with a small conical hole at
    <span class="smcap">m</span>. A stiff wire passes through <span class="smcap">m</span> and forms the upper
    portion of the index <span class="smcap">i</span>, the lower portion of which is a thin
    piece of bamboo. Fixed upon the wire there is a small brass ball which
    rests on the upper side of a second brass plate also perforated with a
    conical hole, which plate is fixed on the bar <span class="smcap">o o</span> crossing the
    box.</p>

  <p>If at the time of an earthquake the upper part of the index <span class="smcap">i</span>
    remains steady at <span class="smcap">m</span>, then by the motion at <span class="smcap">o</span>, the
    lower end of the index which carries a sliding needle at <span class="smcap">g</span>,
    will magnify the motion of the earth in the ratios <span class="smcap">m o</span> :
    <span class="smcap">o g</span>. In this instrument <span class="smcap">o g</span> is about 17 cm.</p>

  <p>The needle <span class="smcap">g</span> works upon a piece of smoked glass. In
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> order to
    bring the glass into contact with the needle without disturbance, the
    glass is carried on a strip of wood <span class="smcap">k</span>, hinged at the back of
    the box, and propped up in front by a loose block of wood <span class="smcap">y</span>.
    When <span class="smcap">y</span> is removed the glass drops down with <span class="smcap">k</span> out of
    contact with the needle. The box is carried on bars of wood
    <span class="smcap">c c</span>, which are fixed to the ground by the stakes <span class="smcap">a</span>
    <span class="smcap">a</span>.</p>

  <p>The great advantage of a pendulum seismograph working on a stationary
    plate is, that the record shows at once whether the direction of motion
    has been constant, or whether it has been variable. The maximum extent
    of motion in various directions is also easily obtained.</p>

  <p>The disadvantage of the instrument is, that at the time of a large
    earthquake, owing perhaps to a slight swing in the pendulum, the
    records may be unduly magnified.</p>

  <p>On such occasions, however, fairly good records may be obtained from
    the friction pointers, provided that the plates on which they work have
    been previously smoked. It might perhaps be well to use two of these
    instruments, one having a comparatively high frictional resistance, and
    hence ‘dead beat’ for large displacements.</p>

  <p>Many attempts have been made to use a pendulum seismograph in
    conjunction with a record-receiving surface, which at the time of the
    earthquake should be kept in motion by clockwork. In this way it was
    hoped to separate the various vibrations of the earthquake, and thus
    avoid the greater or less confusion which occurs when the index of the
    pendulum writes its backward and forward motion on a stationary plate.
    Hitherto all attempts in this direction, in which a single multiplying
    index was used, have been unsuccessful because of the moving plate
    dragging the index in the direction of its motion for a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> short
    distance, and then allowing it to fall back towards its normal position.</p>

  <p>In connection with this subject we may mention the pendulum
    seismographs of Kreil, Wagener, Ewing, and Gray.</p>

  <p>In the bob of Kreil’s pendulum there was clockwork, which caused a disc
    on the axis of the pendulum to continuously rotate. On this continually
    revolving surface a style fixed to the earth traced an unbroken circle.
    At the time of an earthquake, by the motion of the style, the circle
    was to be broken and lines drawn. The number and length of these lines
    were to indicate the length and intensity of the disturbance.</p>

  <p>Gray’s pendulum consisted of a flat heavy disc carrying on its upper
    surface a smoked glass plate. This, which formed the bob of the
    pendulum, was supported by a pianoforte steel wire. When set ready to
    receive an earthquake, the wire was twisted and the bob held by a catch
    so arranged that at the time of the earthquake the catch was released,
    and the bob of the pendulum allowed to turn slowly by the untwisting of
    the supporting wire. Resting on the surface of this rotating disc were
    two multiplying indices arranged to write the earth’s motions as two
    components.</p>

  <p>In the instruments of Wagener and Ewing, the clockwork and moving
    surface do not form part of the pendulum, but rest independently on
    a support rigidly attached to the earth. In Wagener’s instrument one
    index only is used, while in Ewing’s two are used for writing the
    record of the motion.</p>

  <p>A difficulty which is apparent in all pendulum machines is that when
    the bob of such a pendulum is deflected it tends to fall back to its
    normal position. To make a pendulum perfect it therefore requires
    some compensating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    arrangement, so that the pendulum, for small
    displacements, shall be in neutral equilibrium, and the errors due to
    swinging shall be avoided.</p>

  <p>Several methods have been suggested for making the bob of an ordinary
    pendulum astatic for small displacements. One method proposed by Gray
    consists in fixing in the bob of a pendulum a circular trough of
    liquid, the curvature of this trough having a proper form. Another
    method which was suggested, was to attach a vertical spiral spring
    to a point in the axis of the pendulum a little below the point of
    suspension, and to a fixed point above it, so that when the pendulum is
    deflected it would introduce a couple.</p>

  <p>Professor Ewing has suggested an arrangement so that the bob of the
    pendulum shall be partly suspended by a stretched spiral spring, and at
    the same time shall be partly held up from below by a vertically placed
    strut, the weight carried by the strut being to the weight carried by
    the spring in the ratio of their respective lengths. As to how these
    arrangements will act when carried into practice yet remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>Another important class of instruments are <em>inverted pendulums</em>. These
    are vertical springs made of metal or wood loaded at their upper end
    with a heavy mass of metal. An arrangement of this sort, provided at
    its upper end with a pencil to write on a concave surface, was employed
    in 1841 to register the earthquakes at Comrie in Scotland. In Japan
    they were largely employed in series, each member of a series having
    a different period of vibration. The object of these arrangements
    was to determine which of the pendulums, with a given earthquake,
    recorded the greatest motion, it being assumed that the one which was
    thrown into the most violent oscillation would be the one most nearly
    approximating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
    with the period of the earthquake. The result of these
    experiments showed that it was usually those with a slow period of
    vibration which were the most disturbed.</p>

  <p><em>Bracket Seismographs.</em>—A group of instruments of recent origin which
    have done good work, are the bracket seismographs. These instruments
    appear to have been independently invented by several investigators:
    the germ from which they originated probably being the well-known
    horizontal pendulum of Professor Zöllner. In Japan they were first
    employed by Professor W. S. Chaplin. Subsequently they were used by
    Professor Ewing and Mr. Gray. They consist essentially of a heavy
    weight supported at the extremity of a horizontal bracket which is free
    to turn on a vertical axis at its other end. When the frame carrying
    this axis is moved in any direction excepting parallel to the length
    of the gate-like bracket, the weight causes the bracket to turn round
    a line known as the instantaneous axis of the bracket corresponding to
    this motion of the fixed axis. Any point in this line may therefore be
    taken as a steady point for motions at right angles to the length of
    the supporting bracket. Two of these instruments placed at right angles
    to each other have to be employed in conjunction, and the motion of
    the ground is written down as two rectangular components. In Professor
    Ewing’s form of the instrument, light prolongations of the brackets
    form indices which give magnified representations of the motion, and
    the weights are pivoted round a vertical axis through their centre.</p>

  <p>In the accompanying sketch <span class="smcap">b</span> is a heavy weight pivoted at the
    end of a small bracket <span class="smcap">c a k</span>, which bracket is free to turn
    on a knife-edge, <span class="smcap">k</span>, above, and a pivot <span class="smcap">a</span>, below,
    in the stand <span class="smcap">s</span>. At the time of an earthquake <span class="smcap">b</span>
    remains steady, and the index <span class="smcap">p</span>, forming a continuation
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> of
    the bracket, magnifies the motion of the stand, in the ratio of
    <span class="smcap">a c</span> : <span class="smcap">c n</span>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p028a.jpg" width="500" height="225" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>In an instrument called a double-bracket seismograph, invented by Mr.
    Gray, we have two brackets hinged to each other, and one of them to a
    fixed frame. The planes of the two brackets are placed at right angles,
    so as to give to a heavy mass supported at the end of the outer bracket
    two degrees of horizontal freedom.</p>

  <p>In all bracket machines, especially those which carry a pivoted weight,
    it is doubtful whether the weight provides a truly steady point
    relatively to the plate on which the record is written for motion
    parallel to the direction of the arm.</p>

  <div class="figleft">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><em>Parallel motion Instrument.</em>—A machine which writes its record as
    two components, and which promises great stability,
    is one suggested
    by Professor C. D. West. Like the bracket machines it consists of two
    similar parts placed at right angles to each other, and is as follows:
    A bar of iron <span class="smcap">a</span> is suspended from both sides on pivots at
    <span class="smcap">c c</span> by a system of light arms hinging with each other at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> the
    black dots, between the upper and lower parts of the rigid frame
    <span class="smcap">b c</span>. The arms are of such a length that for small displacements
    parallel to the length of the bar, <span class="smcap">c c</span> practically move
    in a straight line, and the bar is in neutral equilibrium. A light
    prolongation of the bar <i>d</i> works the upper end of the light index <i>e</i>,
    passing as a universal joint through the rigid support <span class="smcap">f</span>. A
    second index <i>e′</i> from the bar at right angles also passes through
    <span class="smcap">f</span>. The multiplying ends of these indices are coupled together
    to write a resultant motion on a smoked glass plate <span class="smcap">s</span>.</p>

  <p><em>Conical Pendulums.</em>—Another group of instruments which have also
    yielded valuable records are the conical pendulum seismographs. The
    idea of using the bob of a conical pendulum to give a steady point in
    an earthquake machine was first suggested and carried into practice by
    Mr. Gray. The seismograph as employed consists of a pair of conical
    pendulums hung in planes at right angles to each other. The bob of each
    of these pendulums is fixed a short distance from the end of a light
    lever, which forms the writing index, the short end resting as a strut
    against the side of a post fixed in the earth. The weight is carried by
    a thin wire or thread, the upper end of which is attached to a point
    vertically above the fixed end of the lever.</p>

  <p><em>Rolling Spheres and Cylinders.</em>—After the conical pendulum
    seismographs, which claim several important advantages over the bracket
    machines, we come to a group of instruments known as rolling sphere
    seismographs. Here, again, we have a class of instruments for the
    various forms of which we are indebted to the ingenuity of Mr. Gray.</p>

  <p>The general arrangement and principle of one of these instruments will
    be readily understood from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
    accompanying figure. <span class="smcap">s</span> is a
    segment of a large sphere with a centre near <span class="smcap">c</span>. Slightly below
    this centre a heavy weight <span class="smcap">b</span>, which may be a lead ring, is
    pivoted. At the time of an earthquake <span class="smcap">c</span> is steady, and the
    earth’s motions are magnified by the pointer <span class="smcap">c a n</span> in the
    proportion of <span class="smcap">c a</span> : <span class="smcap">a n</span>. The working of this pointer
    or index is similar to that of the pointer in the pendulum.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p030.jpg" width="400" height="356" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>Closely connected with the rolling sphere seismographs, are Gray’s
    rolling cylinder seismographs.</p>

  <p>These are two cylinders resting on a surface plate with their axes at
    right angles to each other. Near to the highest point in each of these
    cylinders, this point remaining nearly steady when the surface plate
    is moved backwards and forwards, there is attached the end of a light
    index. These indices are again pivoted a short distance from their ends
    on axes connected with the surface plate. In order that the two indices
    may be brought parallel, one is cranked at the second pivot.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <p><em>Ball and Plate Seismograph.</em>—Another form of seismograph, which is
    closely related to the two forms of apparatus just described, is
    Verbeck’s ball and plate seismograph. This consists of a surface plate
    resting on three hard spheres, which in turn rests upon a second
    surface plate. When the lower plate is moved, the upper one tends to
    remain at rest, and thus may be used as a steady mass to move an index.</p>

  <p><em>The Principle of Perry and Ayrton.</em>—An instrument which is of interest
    from the scientific principle it involves is a seismograph suggested
    by Professors Perry and Ayrton, who propose to support a heavy ball on
    three springs, which shall be sufficiently stiff to have an exceedingly
    quick period of vibration. By means of pencils attached to the ball by
    levers, the motions of the ball are to be recorded on a moving band of
    paper. The result would be a record compounded of the small vibrations
    of the springs superimposed on the larger, slower, wave-like motions
    of the earthquake, and, knowing the former of these, the latter might
    be separated by analysis. Although our present knowledge of earthquake
    motion indicates that the analysis of such a record would often present
    us with insuperable difficulties, this instrument is worthy of notice
    on account of the novelty of the principle it involves, which, the
    authors truly remark, has in seismometry been a ‘neglected’ one.</p>

  <p><em>Instruments to record Vertical Motion.</em>—The instruments which have
    been devised to record vertical motion are almost as numerous as those
    which have been devised to record horizontal motion. The earliest
    form of instrument employed for this purpose was a spiral spring
    stretched by weight, which, on account of its inertia, was supposed
    at the time of a shock to remain steady. No satisfactory results have
    ever been obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
    from such instruments, chiefly on account of the
    inconvenience in making a spring sufficiently long to allow of enough
    elongation to give a long period of vibration. Similar remarks may
    be applied to the horizontally placed elastic rods, one end of which
    is fixed to a wall, whilst the opposite end is loaded with a weight.
    Such contrivances, furnished with pencil on the weight to write a
    record upon a vertical surface, were used in 1842 at Comrie, and we
    see the same principle applied in a portion of Palmieri’s apparatus.
    Contrivances like these neither give us the true amplitude of the
    vertical motion, insomuch as they are readily set in a state of
    oscillation; nor do they indicate the duration of a disturbance, for,
    being once set in motion, they continue that motion in virtue of their
    inertia long after the actual earthquake has ceased. They can only be
    regarded as seismoscopes.</p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/i_p032.jpg" width="280" height="496" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The most satisfactory instrument which has yet been devised for
    recording vertical motion is Gray’s horizontal lever spring seismograph.</p>

  <p>This instrument will be better understood from the accompanying sketch.
    A vertical spring <span class="smcap">s</span> is fixed at its upper end by means of a
    nut <i>n</i>, which rests on the top of the frame <span class="smcap">f</span>, and serves to
    raise or lower the spring through a short distance as a last adjustment
    for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
    the position of the cross-arm <span class="smcap">a</span>. The arm <span class="smcap">a</span> rests
    at one end on two sharp points, <i>p</i>, one resting in a conical hole
    and the other in a <span class="smcap">v</span>-slot; it is supported at <span class="smcap">b</span> by
    the spring <span class="smcap">s</span>, and is weighted at <span class="smcap">c</span> with a lead ring
    <span class="smcap">r</span>. Over a pin at the point <span class="smcap">c</span> a stirrup of thread is
    placed which supports a small trough, <i>t</i>. The trough <i>t</i> is pivoted at
    <i>a</i>, has attached to it the index <i>i</i> (which is hinged by means of a
    strip of tough paper at <i>h</i>, and rests through a fine pin on the glass
    plate <i>g</i>), and is partly filled with mercury.</p>

  <p>Another method of obtaining a steady point for vertical motion is that
    of Dr. Wagener, who employs a buoy partly immersed in a vessel of
    water. This was considerably improved upon by Mr. Gray, who suggested
    the use of a buoy, which, with the exception of a long thin style, was
    completely sunk.</p>

  <p>Among the other forms of apparatus used to record vertical motion may
    be mentioned vessels provided with india-rubber or other flexible
    bottoms, and partially filled with water or some other liquid. As the
    vessel is moved up and down, the bottom tends to remain behind and
    provides a more or less steady point. Pivoted to this is a light index,
    which is again pivoted to a rigid frame in connection with the earth.
    Instruments of this description have yielded good records.</p>

  <p><em>Record Receivers.</em>—A large number of earthquake machines having been
    referred to, it now remains to consider the apparatus on which they
    write their motions. The earlier forms of seismographs, as has already
    been indicated, recorded their movements in a bed of sand; others
    wrote their records by means of pencils on sheets of paper. Where we
    have seismographs which magnify the motion of the earth, it will be
    observed that methods like the above would involve great frictional
    resistances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
    tending to cause motion in the assumed steady points of
    the seismographs. One of the most perfect instruments would be obtained
    by registering photographically the motions of the recording index by
    the reflection of a ray of light. Such an instrument would, however,
    be difficult to construct and difficult to manipulate. One of the best
    practical forms of registering apparatus is one in which the record is
    written on a surface of smoked glass. This can afterwards be covered
    with a coat of photographer’s varnish, and subsequently photographed by
    the ‘blue process’ so well known to engineers.</p>

  <p>To obtain a record of all the vibrations of an earthquake it is
    necessary that the surface on which the seismograph writes should at
    the time of an earthquake be in motion. Of record-receiving machines
    there are three types. First, there are those which move continuously.
    The common form of these is a circular glass plate like an old form of
    chronograph, driven continuously by clockwork. On this the pointers of
    the seismograph rest and trace over and over again the same circles.
    At the time of an earthquake they move back and forth across the
    circles, which are theoretically fine lines, and leave a record of
    the earthquake. Instead of a circular plate, a drum covered with
    smoked paper may be used, which, after the earthquake, possesses the
    advantage, after unrolling, of presenting the record in a straight
    line, instead of a record written round the periphery of a circle, as
    is the case with the circular glass plates. Such records are easily
    preserved, but they are more difficult to photograph.</p>

  <p>The second form of apparatus is one which is set in motion at the
    time of a shock. This may be a contrivance like one of those just
    described, or a straight smoked glass plate on a carriage. By means
    of an electrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
    or a mechanical contrivance called a ‘starter,’ of
    which many forms have been contrived, the earthquake is caused to
    release a detent and thus set in motion the mechanism which moves the
    record receiver.</p>

  <p>The great advantage of continuously-moving machines is that the
    beginning and end of the shock can usually be got with certainty, while
    all the uncertainty as to the action of the ‘starter’ is avoided.
    Self-starting machines have, of course, the advantage of simplicity and
    cheapness, while there is no danger of the record getting obliterated
    by the subsequent motion of the plate under the index.</p>

  <p><em>Time-recording Apparatus.</em>—Of equal importance with the instruments
    which record the motion of the ground, are those instruments which
    record the time at which such motion took place. The great value of
    time records, when determining the origin from which an earthquake
    originates, will be shown farther on. The most important result which
    is required in connection with time observations, is to determine
    the interval of time taken by a disturbance in travelling from one
    point to another. On account of the great velocity with which these
    disturbances sometimes travel, it is necessary that these observations
    should be made with considerable accuracy. The old methods of adapting
    an apparatus to a clock which, when shaken, shall cause the clock to
    stop, are of little value unless the stations at which the observations
    are made are at considerable distances apart. This will be appreciated
    when we remember that the disturbance may possibly travel at the rate
    of a mile per second, that its duration at any station may often extend
    over a minute, and that one set of apparatus at one station may stop,
    perhaps, at the commencement of the disturbance, and the other near
    the end. A satisfactory time-taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
    apparatus will therefore require,
    not only the means for stopping a clock, but also a contrivance which,
    at the same instant that the clock is stopped, shall make a mark on a
    record which is being drawn by a seismograph. In this way we find out
    at which portion of the shock the time was taken.</p>

  <p>Palmieri stops a clock in his seismograph by closing an electric
    circuit. Mallet proposes to stop a clock by the falling of a column
    which is attached by a string to the pendulum of the clock. So long as
    the column is standing the string is loose and the pendulum is free
    to move; but when the column falls, the string is tightened and the
    pendulum is arrested. The difficulty which arises is to obtain a column
    that will fall with a slight disturbance. The best form of contrivance
    for causing a column to fall, and one which may also be used in drawing
    out a catch to relieve the machinery of a record receiver, is shown in
    the accompanying sketch.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">s</span> is the segment of a sphere about 4·5 cm. radius, with a
    centre slightly above <span class="smcap">c</span>. <span class="smcap">l</span> is a disc of lead about 7
    cm. in diameter resting upon the segment. Above this there is a light
    pointer, <span class="smcap">p</span>, about 30 cm. long. On the top of the pointer a
    small cylinder of iron, <span class="smcap">w</span>, is balanced, and connected by a
    string with the catch to be relieved. When the table on which <span class="smcap">w p s</span>
    rests is shaken, rotation takes place near to <span class="smcap">c</span>, the
    motion of the base <span class="smcap">s</span> is magnified at the upper end of the
    pointer, and the weight overturned. This catch may be used to relieve
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    toothed bar axled at one end, and held up above a pin projecting
    from the face of the pendulum bob. When this falls it catches the
    projecting pin and holds the pendulum.</p>

  <p>Another way of relieving the toothed bar is to hold up the opposite
    end to that at which it is axled by resting it on the extremity of a
    horizontal wire fixed to the bob of a conical pendulum—for example, one
    of the indices of a conical pendulum seismograph. The whole of this
    apparatus, which may be constructed at the cost of a few pence, can be
    made small enough to go inside an ordinary clock case.</p>

  <p>The difficulty which arises with all these clock-stopping arrangements
    is that it is difficult for observers situated at distant stations
    to re-start their clocks so that their difference in time shall
    be accurately known. Even if each observer is provided with a
    well-regulated chronometer, with which he can make comparisons, the
    rating of these instruments is for all ordinary persons an extremely
    troublesome operation.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid this difficulty the author has of late years used a
    method of obtaining the time without stopping the clock. To do this a
    clock with a central seconds hand is taken, and the hour and minute
    hands are prolonged and bent out slightly at their extremities at right
    angles to the face, the hour hand being slightly the longest. Each
    hand is then tipped with a piece of soft material like cork, which is
    smeared with a glycerine ink. A light flat ring, with divisions in it
    corresponding to those on the face of the clock, is so arranged that
    at the time of a shock it can be quickly advanced to touch the inked
    pads on the hands of the clock and then withdrawn. This is accomplished
    by suitable machinery, which is relieved either by an electro-magnet
    or some other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
    contrivance which will withdraw a catch. In this way an
    impression in the form of three dots is received on the disc, and the
    time known without either stopping or sensibly retarding the clock.</p>

  <p>For ordinary observers, if a time-taker is not used in conjunction
    with a record receiver, as good results as those obtained by ordinary
    clock-stopping apparatus are obtainable by glancing at an ordinary
    watch. Subsequently the watch by which the observation was made should
    be compared with some good time-keeper, and the local time at which the
    shock took place is then approximately known.</p>

  <p>From what has now been said it will be seen that for a complete
    seismograph we require three distinct sets of apparatus—an apparatus to
    record horizontal motion, an apparatus to record vertical motion, and
    an apparatus to record time. The horizontal and vertical motions must
    be written on the same receiver, and if possible side by side, whilst
    the instant at which the time record is made a mark must be made on
    the edge of the diagram which is being drawn by the seismograph. Such
    a seismograph has been constructed and is now erected in Japan. It is
    illustrated in the accompanying diagram.</p>

  <p><em>The Gray and Milne Seismograph.</em>—In this apparatus two mutually
    rectangular components of the horizontal motion of the earth are
    recorded on a sheet of smoked paper wound round a drum, <span class="smcap">d</span>,
    kept continuously in motion by clockwork, <span class="smcap">w</span>, by means of two
    conical pendulum seismographs, <span class="smcap">c</span>. The vertical motion is
    recorded on the same sheet of paper by means of a compensated-spring
    seismograph, <span class="smcap">s l m b</span>.</p>

  <p>The time of occurrence of an earthquake is determined by causing the
    circuit of two electro-magnets to be closed by the shaking. One of
    these magnets relieves a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
    mechanism, forming part of a time-keeper, which causes the dial of the
    timepiece to come suddenly forwards on the hands and then move back
    to its original position. The hands are provided with ink-pads, which
    mark their positions on the dial, thus indicating the hour, minute, and
    second when the circuit was closed. The second
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> electro-magnet causes a
    pointer to make a mark on the paper receiving the record of the motion.
    This mark indicates the part of the earthquake at which the circuit was
    closed.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p039.jpg" width="625" height="699" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The duration of the earthquake is estimated from the length of the
    record on the smoked paper and the rate of motion of the drum. The
    nature and period of the different movements are obtained from the
    curves drawn on the paper.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gray has since greatly modified this apparatus, notably by the
    introduction of a band of paper sufficiently long to take a record for
    twenty-four hours without repetition. The record is written in ink by
    means of fine siphons. In this way the instrument, which is extremely
    sensitive to change of level, can be made to show not only earthquakes,
    but the pulsations of long period which have recently occupied so much
    attention.</p>

  <p><em>Ideas of Early Writers.</em>—One of the first accounts of the varieties of
    motion which may be experienced at the time of an earthquake is to be
    found in the classification of earthquakes given by
    Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
    It is as follows:—</p>

  <p>1. Epiclintæ, or earthquakes which move the ground obliquely.</p>

  <p>2. Brastæ, with an upward vertical motion like boiling water.</p>

  <p>3. Chasmatiæ, which cause the ground to sink and form hollows.</p>

  <p>4. Rhectæ, which raise the ground and make fissures.</p>

  <p>5. Ostæ, which overthrow with one thrust.</p>

  <p>6. Palmatiæ, which shake from side to side with a sort of tremor.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

  <p>From the sixth group in this classification we see that this early
    writer did not regard earthquakes as necessarily isolated events, but
    that some of them consisted of a succession of backward and forward
    vibratory motions. He also distinguishes between the total duration of
    an earthquake and the length of, and intervals between, a series of
    shocks. Aristotle had, in fact, some idea of what modern writers upon
    ordinary earthquakes would term ‘modality.’</p>

  <p>The earliest writer who had the idea that an earthquake was a
    pulse-like motion propagated through solid ground appears to have been
    Francisci Travagini, who, in 1679, wrote upon an earthquake which
    in 1667 had overthrown Ragusa. The method in which the pulses were
    propagated he illustrated by experiments.</p>

  <p>Hooke, who, in 1690, delivered discourses on earthquakes before the
    Royal Society, divides these phenomena according to the geological
    effects they have produced; thus there is a <em>genus</em> producing
    elevations, a <em>genus</em> producing sinkings, a <em>genus</em> producing
    conversions and transportations, and a <em>genus</em> which produces what, in
    modern language, we should term metamorphic action.</p>

  <p>Woodward, in his ‘Natural History,’ written in 1695, speaks of
    earthquakes as being agitations and concussions produced by water in
    the interior of the earth coming in contact with internal fires.</p>

  <p>Stukeley observed that an earthquake was ‘a tremor of the earth,’ to
    be explained as a vibration in a solid. The Rev. John Mitchell, writing
    in 1760, says that the motion of the earth in earthquakes is partly
    tremulous and partly propagated by waves.</p>

  <p>From these few examples, to which might be added many more, it will
    be seen that an earthquake disturbance has usually been regarded as
    a concussion, vibration, trembling, or undulatory movement. Further,
    it can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
    seen in narratives of earthquakes that it had been often
    observed that these tremblings and shakings continued over a certain
    period of time. Although it had been noticed that large areas were
    almost simultaneously affected by these disturbances, no definite idea
    appears to have existed as to how earthquake motion was propagated.
    Usually it was assumed that the disturbance spread through subterranean
    channels.</p>

  <p>The first true conception of earthquake motion and the manner of its
    propagation is due to Dr. Thomas Young, who suggested that earthquake
    motion was vibratory, and it might be ‘propagated through the earth
    nearly in the same manner as a noise is conveyed through the air.’ The
    same idea was moulded into a more definite form by Gay Lussac.</p>

  <p>The first accurate definition of an earthquake is due to Mr. Robert
    Mallet, who, after collecting and examining many facts connected with
    earthquake phenomena, and reasoning on these, with the help of known
    laws connected with the production and propagation of waves of various
    descriptions, formulated his views as follows:—</p>

  <p>An earthquake is ‘<em>the transit of a wave or waves of elastic
      compression in any direction from vertically upwards to horizontally,
      in any azimuth, through the crust and surface of the earth, from any
      centre of impulse or from more than one, and which may be attended
      with sound and tidal waves, dependent upon the impulse and upon
      circumstances of position as to sea and land</em>.’</p>

  <p>In brief, so far as motion in the earth is concerned. Mallet defined
    an earthquake as being a motion due to the transit of waves of elastic
    compression. In many cases it is possible that this is strictly true,
    but in succeeding pages it will be shown that earthquake motion may
    also be due to the transit of waves of elastic distortion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

  <p>To obtain a true idea of earthquake motion is a matter of cardinal
    importance, as it forms the key-stone of many investigations.</p>

  <p>If we know the nature of the motion produced by an earthquake, we are
    aided in tracking it to its origin, and in reasoning as to how it was
    produced. If our knowledge of the nature of the motion of an earthquake
    is incorrect, it will be impossible for us intelligently to construct
    buildings to withstand the effects of these disturbances. We have thus
    to consider, in this portion of seismology, a point of great scientific
    importance, and shall deal with it at some length.</p>

  <p><em>Nature of Elastic Waves and Vibrations.</em>—When it is stated that an
    earthquake consists of elastic waves of compression and distortion, the
    student of physics has a clear idea of what is meant and a knowledge
    of the mechanical laws which govern such disturbances. The ordinary
    reader, however, and the majority of the inhabitants of earthquake
    countries, who of all people have the greatest interest in this matter,
    may not have so clear a conception, and it will, therefore, not be out
    of place to give some general explanation on this point.</p>

  <p>The ordinary idea of a wave is that it is a disturbance similar to
    that which we often see in water. Waves like these must not, however,
    be confounded with elastic waves. A disturbance produced in water,
    say, for instance, by dropping a stone into a pond, is propagated
    outwards by the action of gravity. First, a ridge of water is raised
    up by the stone passing beneath the surface. As this ridge falls
    towards its normal position in virtue of its weight, it raises a second
    ridge. This second ridge raises a third ridge, and so on. The water
    moves vertically up and down, whilst the wave itself is propagated
    horizontally.</p>

  <p>To understand what is meant by elastic waves, it is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> first necessary
    to understand what is meant by the term elastic. In popular language
    the term elastic is confined to substances like india-rubber, and but
    seldom to rock-like materials, through which earthquake waves are
    propagated. India-rubber is called elastic because after we remove a
    compressive force it has a tendency to spring back to its original
    shape. The elastic force of the india-rubber is in this case the force
    which causes it to resist a change of form. Now, a piece of rock may,
    up to a certain point, like the india-rubber, be compressed, and when
    the compressing force is removed it will also tend to resume its
    original form. However, as the rock offers more resistance to the
    compressing force than the india-rubber offers, we say that it is the
    more elastic. It may be here observed that a substance like granite
    offers great resistance, not only to compression or a change of volume,
    but also to a change of form or shape; whereas a substance like air,
    which is also elastic, only offers resistance to compression, but not
    to a change of shape.</p>

  <p>With these ideas before us we will now proceed to consider how, after
    a body has been suddenly compressed or distorted, this disturbance
    is propagated through the mass. For the elastic body let us take a
    long spiral spring hung from the ceiling of a room and kept slightly
    stretched by a weight. If we give this weight an upward tap from below,
    say with a hammer, we shall observe a pulse-like wave which runs up the
    spring until it reaches the ceiling of the room. Here it will, so to
    speak, rebound, like a billiard ball from the end of a table, and run
    towards the weight from which it started. Whilst this is going on we
    may also observe that the weight is moving up and down.</p>

  <p>Here, then, we have two distinct things to observe—one being the
    transmission of motion up to the ceiling,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> which we may liken to the
    transmission of an earthquake wave between two distant localities on
    the earth’s surface, and the other being the up and down motion of our
    weight, which we may compare to the backward and forward swinging which
    we experience at the time of an earthquake.</p>

  <p>These two motions—namely, the pulse-like wave produced by the
    transmission of motion, and the backward and forward oscillation of the
    weight or of any point on the spring—must be carefully distinguished
    from each other.</p>

  <p>First, we will consider the backward and forward motion of the weight.
    The distance through which the weight moves depends upon the force
    of the blow. The number of up and down oscillations it makes, say
    in a second, depends upon the stiffness of the spring. The weight,
    supposing it to be always the same, will move more quickly at the end
    of a stiff spring than at the end of a flaccid one; that is to say, its
    velocity is quicker. As in any given spring the number of up and down
    oscillations are always the same in a given interval of time, if these
    oscillations are of great extent, the weight must move more quickly
    with large than with small oscillations.</p>

  <p>At the time of an earthquake the manner in which we are moved backward
    and forward is very similar to the manner in which the weight is moved.
    If we stand on a hard rock-like granite, we are to a great extent
    placed as if we were attached to a stiff quickly-vibrating spring.
    If, however, we are on a soft rock, it is more like being on a loose
    flaccid spring.</p>

  <p>All that has thus far been considered has been a backward and forward
    kind of motion, where there is a rectilinear <em>compression</em> and
    <em>extension</em> amongst the particles on which we stand.</p>

  <p>We might, however, imagine our rock, which for the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> moment we will
    consider to be a square column, to be twisted, and thus have its
    <em>shape</em> altered. When the twisting force is taken off it seems evident
    that the column would endeavour to untwist itself or regain its
    original form. Now the force which a body offers against a change of
    <em>volume</em> may be very different from that which it offers against a
    change of <em>form</em>.</p>

  <p>In disturbances which take place in the rocky crust of our earth,
    it would seem possible that we may have vibrations set up which are
    either compressions and extensions or twistings and distortions. These
    may take place separately or simultaneously, or we may have resultant
    motions due to their combination.</p>

  <p>The following are examples of possible causes which might give rise to
    these different orders of disturbance:—</p>

  <p>1. Imagine a large area stretched by elevation until it reaches the
    limit of its elasticity and cracks. After cracking, in consequence
    of its elasticity, it will fly back over the whole area like a
    broken spring, and each point in the area will oscillate round its
    new position of equilibrium. In this case there will be no waves
    of distortion excepting near the end of the crack, where waves are
    transmitted in a direction parallel to the fissure.</p>

  <p>2. The ground is broken and slips either up, down, or sideways, as
    we see to have taken place in the production of faults. Here we get
    distortion in the direction of the movement, and waves are produced
    by the elastic force of the rock, causing it to spring back from its
    distorted form. In a case like this the production of a fissure running
    north and south might give rise to north and south vibrations, which
    would be propagated end on towards the north and south, but broadside
    on towards the east and west. With disturbances of this kind, on
    account of the want of homogeneousness in the materials
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> in which
    they are produced, we should expect to find waves of compression and
    extension.</p>

  <p>3. A truly spherical cavity is suddenly formed by the explosion of
    steam in the midst of an elastic medium. In this case all the waves
    will be those of compression, each particle moving backward and forward
    along a radius.</p>

  <p>Should the cavity, instead of being truly spherical, be irregular, it
    is evident that, in addition to the normal vibration of compression,
    transverse waves of distortion will be more or less pronounced,
    depending upon the nature of the cavity.</p>

  <p>The combination of these two sets of vibrations may cause a point in
    the earth to move in a circle, an ellipse, the form of a figure eight,
    and in other curves similar to these, which are produced by apparatus
    designed to show the combination of harmonic motion. From these
    examples it will be seen that we have therefore to consider two kinds
    of vibrations—one produced by compression or the alteration of volume,
    and the other produced by an alteration in shape.</p>

  <p>Now the resistance which a body offers, either to a change in its
    volume or in its shape, is called its elasticity, and the law which
    governs the backward and forward motion of a particle under the
    influence of this elasticity may be expressed as follows:</p>

  <p>If <span class="smcap">t</span> be the time of vibration, or the time taken by a particle
    to make one complete backward and forward swing, <span class="smcap">d</span> the density
    of the material of which this particle forms a part, and <span class="smcap">e</span> the
    proper modulus of elasticity of the material, then,</p>

  <div class="center">
    <span class="smcap">t</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2π&nbsp;<span class="x200a">√</span><span class="sqrt2"><span class="frac"><sup><span class="smcap">d</span></sup><span>/</span><sub><span class="smcap">e</span></sub></span></span>
  </div>

  <p>From this formula,
    <span class="smcap">t</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2π&nbsp;<span class="x200a">√</span><span class="sqrt2"><span class="frac"><sup><span class="smcap">d</span></sup><span>/</span><sub><span class="smcap">e</span></sub></span></span>,
    we see that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
    time of vibration of the earth during an earthquake,
    or the rate at which we are shaken backwards and forwards, varies
    directly as the square root of the density of the material on which we
    stand, and inversely as the square root of a number proportional to its
    elasticity.</p>

  <p><em>Velocity and Acceleration of an Earth Particle.</em>—Another important
    point, which the practical seismologist has often brought to
    his notice, is the question of the velocity with which an earth
    particle moves. According to the formula,
    <span class="smcap">t</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2π&nbsp;<span class="x200a">√</span><span class="sqrt2"><span class="frac"><sup><span class="smcap">d</span></sup><span>/</span><sub><span class="smcap">e</span></sub></span></span>,
    we should expect that a particle would
    make each semi-vibration in an equal time, and from a knowledge of the
    density and elastic moduli of a body this time might be calculated.
    Although the time of a semi-oscillation may be constant, we must bear
    in mind that, like the bob of a pendulum during each of its swings, the
    particle starts from rest, increases in velocity until it reaches the
    middle portion of its half swing, from which it gradually decreases in
    speed until it reaches zero, when it again commences a similar motion
    in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>These pendulum-like vibrations are sometimes spoken of as simple
    harmonic motions. If we know the distance through which an earthquake
    moves in making a single swing, and the time taken in making this
    swing, on the assumption that the motion is simple harmonic we can
    easily calculate the maximum velocity with which the particle moves.</p>

  <p>Thus, if an earth particle takes one second to complete a
    semi-oscillation, half of which, or the amplitude of the motion, equals
    <i>a</i>, the maximum velocity equals <i>π</i> × <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, assuming the earth vibrations to be simple harmonic, the maximum
    acceleration or rate of change in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
    velocity will come about at the ends
    of each semi-oscillation; and if <span class="smcap">v</span> be the maximum velocity of
    the particle, and <i>a</i> the amplitude or half semi-oscillation, then the
    maximum acceleration equals
    <span class="frac"><sup><span class="smcap">v</span><sup>2</sup></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>a</i></sub></span>.</p>

  <p>Later on it will be shown, as the result of experiment, that certain of
    the more important earth oscillations in an earthquake are not simple
    harmonic motion. Nevertheless the above remarks will be of assistance
    in showing how the velocity and other elements connected with the
    motion of an earth particle, which are required by the practical
    seismologist, may be calculated, irrespective of assumptions as to the
    nature of the motion.</p>

  <p><em>Propagation of a Disturbance.</em>—We may next consider the manner in
    which a disturbance, in which there are both vibrations of compression
    and of distortion, is propagated. The first or normal set of vibrations
    are propagated in a manner similar to that in which sound vibrations
    are propagated. From a centre of disturbance these movements approach
    an observer at a distant station, so to speak, end on. The other
    vibrations have a direction of motion similar to that which we believe
    to exist in a ray of light. These would approach the observer broadside
    on.</p>

  <p>If the disturbance passed through a formation like a series of
    perfectly laminated slates, each of these two sets of vibration might
    be subdivided, and we should then obtain what Mallet has termed
    ordinary and extraordinary normal and transverse vibrations.</p>

  <p>In consequence of the difference in the elastic forces on which the
    propagation of these two kinds of vibration depends, the normal
    vibrations are transmitted faster than the transversal ones—that is
    to say, if an earthquake originated from a blow, the first thing that
    would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    felt at a point distant from the origin of the shock would be
    a backward and forward motion in the direction to and from the origin,
    and then, a short interval afterwards, a motion transversal, or at
    right angles to this, would be experienced.</p>

  <p>From the mathematical theory of vibratory motions it is possible to
    calculate the velocity with which a disturbance is propagated. As the
    result of these investigations it has been shown that normal vibrations
    travel more quickly than transverse vibrations.</p>

  <p>Deductions from experiments on small specimens are, however,
    invalidated by the fact that the specimens used for experiments are,
    of course, nearly homogeneous, whilst the earthquake passes through
    a mass which is heterogeneous and more or less fissured. Mallet, by
    experiments ‘on the compressibility of solid cubes of these rocks,
    obtained the mean modulus of elasticity,’ with the result that ‘nearly
    seven-eighths of the full velocity of wave-transit due to the material,
    if solid and continuous, is lost by reason of the heterogeneity and
    discontinuity of the rocky masses as they are found piled together in
    nature.’ The full velocities of wave-transit, as calculated by Mallet
    from a theorem given by Poisson, were—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      For slate and quartz transverse to lamination, 9,691 feet per second.<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;„&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp;„&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in line of lamination,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5,415
      &nbsp; &nbsp;„&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; „
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This more rapid transmission in a direction transverse to the
    lamination, Mr. Mallet observes, may be more than counterbalanced by
    the discontinuity of the mass transverse to the same direction.</p>

  <p><em>The Intensity of an Earthquake.</em>—The intensity of an earthquake
    is best estimated by the intensity of the forces which are brought
    to bear on bodies placed on the earth’s surface. These forces are
    evidently proportional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
    to the rate of change of velocity in the body,
    and, as the destructive effect will be proportional to the maximum
    forces, we may consistently indicate the intensity of an earthquake by
    giving the maximum acceleration to which bodies were subject during
    the disturbance. On the assumption that the motion of a point on
    the earth’s surface is simple harmonic, the maximum acceleration is
    directly as the maximum velocity and inversely as the amplitude of
    motion, or as
    <span class="frac"><sup><i>v</i><sup>2</sup></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>a</i></sub></span>
    where <i>v</i> indicates velocity and <i>a</i> amplitude.</p>

  <p>The next question of importance is to determine the manner in which
    earthquake energy becomes dissipated—that is, to compare together
    the intensity of an earthquake as recorded at two or more points at
    different distances from the origin. First let us imagine the origin
    of our earthquake to be surrounded by concentric shells, each of
    which is the breadth of the vibration of a particle. Going outwards
    from the centre, each successive shell will contain a greater number
    of particles, this number increasing directly as the square of the
    distance from the origin. Let the blow have its origin at the centre,
    and give a vibratory movement to the particles in one of the shells
    near the centre.</p>

  <p>This shell may be supposed to possess a certain amount of energy,
    which will be measured by its mass and the square of the velocity of
    its particles. In transferring this energy to the neighbouring shell
    which surrounds it, because it has to set in motion a greater number
    of particles than it contains itself, the energy in any one particle
    of the second layer will be less than the energy in any one particle
    in the first layer; the total energy in the second shell, however,
    will be equal to the total energy in the first shell. Neglecting the
    energy lost during the transfer, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
    the energy in a particle of the
    first shell at any particular phase of the motion be <span class="smcap">k</span><sub>1</sub>,
    and the energy in a particle of the second shell <span class="smcap">k</span><sub>2</sub>, these
    quantities are to each other inversely as the masses of the shells—that
    is, inversely as the squares of the mean radii of the shells.</p>

  <p>In symbols,

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">where <i>f</i> &lt; 1 is the rate of dissipation of energy which is assumed to
    be constant.</p>

  <p><em>Area of greatest Overturning Moment.</em>—Although the rate of dissipation
    of the impulsive effects of an earthquake may follow a law like that
    just enumerated, it must be remembered that if the depth of the origin
    is comparable with the radius of the area which is shaken, the maximum
    impulsive effect as exhibited by the actual destruction on the surface
    may not be immediately above the origin where buildings have simply
    been lifted vertically up and down, but at some distance from this
    point, where the impulsive effort has been more oblique.</p>

  <p>At the <em>epicentrum</em> we have the maximum of the true intensity as
    measured by the acceleration of a particle, or the height to which
    a body might be projected, but it will be at some distance from
    this where we shall have the maximum intensity as exhibited by an
    overturning effort.</p>

  <p>This will be rendered clear by the following diagram.</p>

  <p>In the accompanying diagram let <span class="smcap">o</span> be the origin of a shock,
    and <span class="smcap">o c</span> the seismic vertical equal to <i>r</i>. Let the direct or
    normal shock emerge at <span class="smcap">c</span>, <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>2</sub>, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
    at the angles <i>θ</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>θ</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Assuming that the displacement of an earth particle at <span class="smcap">c</span>
    equals <span class="smcap">c b</span>, and at <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>1</sub> equals <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> <i>b</i><sub>1</sub>,
    and at <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>2</sub> equals <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> <i>b</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., and let these
    displacements <span class="smcap">c b</span>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> <i>b</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> <i>b</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., for
    the sake of argument, vary inversely as <i>r</i>, <i>r</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>r</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p054.jpg" width="460" height="164" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The question is to determine where the horizontal component <span class="smcap">c a</span>
    of these normal motions is a maximum.</p>

  <p>First observe that the triangle <span class="smcap">o c</span> <i>c</i> is similar to <i>a</i>,
    <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>Also <i>r</i> = <span class="frac"><sup><i>h</i></sup><span>/</span><sub>sin <i>θ</i></sub></span>,
    and therefore the normal component <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>
    <i>b</i><sub>1</sub> at <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>1</sub> is equal to
    <span class="smcap">c</span> <span class="frac"><sup>sin <i>θ</i></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>h</i></sub></span>.</p>

  <p>Also <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> <i>b</i><sub>1</sub>, cos <i>θ</i>.</p>

  <div class="center">
    ∴ <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>1</sub> <i>a</i> = <span class="smcap">c</span>
    <span class="frac"><sup>sin <i>θ</i> cos <i>θ</i></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>h</i></sub></span>
    = <span class="frac"><sup><i>c</i></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>h</i></sub></span>
    ∙ <span class="frac"><sup>sin 2<i>θ</i></sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span>,
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">and sin 2<i>θ</i> is greatest when 2<i>θ</i> = 90° or <i>θ</i> = 45°.</p>

  <p>That is to say, the horizontal component reaches a maximum where the
    angle of emergence equals 45°.</p>

  <p>This question has been discussed on the assumption that the amplitude
    of an earth particle varies inversely as its distance from the origin
    of the shock. Should we, however, assume that this amplitude varies
    inversely as the square of the distance from the origin, we are led to
    the result that the area of greatest disturbance is nearer to the point
    where the angle of emergence is 55° 44′ 9″.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> Both of these methods are
    referred to by Mallet, but the first is considered as probably the more
    correct.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquake Waves.</em>—Hitherto we have chiefly considered earthquake
    vibrations; now we will say a few words about earthquake waves. If
    we strike a long iron rod at one end, we can imagine that, as in the
    long spring, a pulse-like motion is transmitted. If the rod be struck
    quickly, the pulses will rapidly succeed each other, and if struck
    slowly the pulses will be at longer intervals. Each individual pulse,
    however, will travel along the rod at the same rate, and hence the
    distance between any two will remain constant; but that distance will
    depend on the interval between the blows producing these pulses being
    equal to the distance travelled by one pulse before the next blow is
    struck.</p>

  <p>From this we see that an irregular disturbance will produce an
    irregular succession of motions; some will be like long undulations in
    a wide deep ocean, whilst others will be like ripples in a shallow bay.
    Again, consider the bar to be struck one blow only, and then left to
    itself. The bar will propagate a series of pulses along its length, due
    to the out and in vibration of its end. These will succeed each other
    at regular intervals, and will be mixed up with the pulses we have
    previously considered.</p>

  <p>From this we see that in an earthquake, if it be produced by one blow,
    the motion will be isochronous in its character; but if it be due to
    a succession of blows at regular intervals, the motion will be the
    resultant of a series of isochronous motions, and will be periodical.
    If the impulses are irregular, you have a motion which is the resultant
    of a number of isochronous motions due to each impulse, but these
    compounded together in a different manner at each instant during the
    earthquake, and giving as a result a motion which is in no sense
    isochronous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
    This approaches more nearly to the actual motions we feel
    as earthquakes.</p>

  <p>If we can imagine the ground shaken by an earthquake, made of a
    transparent material which transmitted less light when compressed,
    and we could look down upon a long extent of this at the time of an
    earthquake, we should see a series of dark bands indicating strips of
    country which were compressed. The distances between these bands might
    be irregular. Keeping our attention on one particular band, this would
    be seen to travel forward in a direction from the source. If we kept
    our eye on one particular point, it would appear to open and shut,
    becoming light and dark alternately.</p>

  <p>As to the existence of these elastic waves in actual earthquakes we
    have no direct experimental evidence. The only kind of wave with which
    we are familiar is a true surface undulation, which, although having
    the appearance of a water-wave, may nevertheless represent a district
    of compression.</p>

  <p><em>Experiments with Falling Weights.</em>—A series of experiments, as the
    nature of the disturbance produced in the surface of the earth when
    a heavy weight is allowed to fall on it, was begun in November 1880
    by Mr. T. Gray and the author. These experiments were carried out at
    the Akabane Engineering Works in Tokio. The weight used was a ball
    of iron weighing about a ton, which in the different experiments was
    allowed to fall from heights varying between ten and thirty-five feet.
    The position of the place where the ball was allowed to fall was such
    that in one direction the vibrations were transmitted up the side of
    a steep hill, in another direction across a pond with perpendicular
    sides, and in another direction across a level plain the material of
    which consisted for the most part of hardened mud extending to a very
    considerable depth. The vibrations produced by the fall of the ball
    were transmitted through this hard mud with considerable intensity to a
    distance of between 300 and 400 feet.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

  <p>The object of the experiment was to find the nature of the vibrations
    produced in the crust of the earth by such a blow, the velocity of
    transmission through this comparatively soft material, the effect of
    hills and excavations in cutting off such disturbances, and the law
    according to which the amplitude of the vibrations diminishes with the
    distance from the source.</p>

  <p>A considerable variety of apparatus was used during these experiments,
    but the most reliable results were obtained from the records of a
    rolling sphere seismograph, which wrote the vibrations on a stationary
    plate, and from the records of two bracket seismographs, similar to
    Professor Ewing’s horizontal lever seismographs, which gave a record
    of the vibrations as two rectangular components on a moving plate of
    smoked glass.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p058.jpg" width="514" height="283" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The general result as to the nature of the disturbance was that two
    distinct sets of vibrations were set up by the blow. In one set the
    direction of motion was along a line joining the point of observation
    with the point from which the disturbance emanated; in the other set
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
    direction of motion was at right angles to that line. The nature
    of the resultant motion will be gathered from fig. 10, which is taken
    from the records drawn by the rolling sphere seismograph at a distance
    of 50 feet, 100 feet, and 200 feet respectively from the point where
    the ball struck the ground. The direct or normal vibrations reached
    the instrument first, and were followed at an interval depending on
    the distance of the instrument from the origin by the transverse
    vibrations. From the records of these two sets of vibrations as
    separated by the bracket seismographs, combined with the known rate of
    motion of the glass plate, the velocity of transmission was found to
    be, for normal vibrations 446–438 feet per second, and for transverse
    vibrations 357–353 feet per second.</p>

  <p>The effect of the hill in cutting off the disturbance seemed to be
    slight, but the direction of the vibrations which ascended the side
    was mostly transverse. The pond, on the other hand, seemed completely
    to cut off the disturbance, which, however, gradually crept round the
    side, so that only a comparatively small triangular area was in shadow.</p>

  <p>The amplitude of the vibrations diminished directly as the distance
    increased for some distance from the origin, but at greater distance
    the rate of diminution seemed to be slower. The transverse vibration
    seemed to die out less quickly than the normal vibrations.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p>These experiments were afterwards very considerably extended by the
    author. In these later experiments charges of from one to two pounds of
    dynamite were placed in bore-holes of various depths and exploded by
    means of electricity. The results obtained confirmed the conclusions
    already arrived at from the former experiments. The experiments on
    velocity, however, seemed to indicate <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
    that the higher the initial
    impulse the greater was the velocity. The velocity of propagation of
    the transverse vibrations seemed to approach more and more to that of
    the directed vibrations as the distance from the origin of disturbance
    increased. Fig. 11 shows the nature of the record obtained from the
    explosion of two pounds of dynamite at the bottom of a bore-hole eight
    feet deep. These records show the interval of time which elapsed
    between the arrival of the normal and the transverse vibrations at
    points distant 100, 250, and 400 feet from the bore-hole. In the case
    of the 100-feet station it will be observed that the motion towards the
    origin is greater than that from the origin. It is also to be noticed
    that the period of vibration becomes greater as the distance from the
    origin increases.</p>

  <p><em>The Intensity of Artificial Disturbances.</em>—The data which we have at
    our disposal for determining the intensity of an earth particle which
    has been caused to vibrate by the explosion of a charge of dynamite are
    a series of records similar to that given on <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>. These disturbances
    are practically surface movements, and may be compared with the
    movements of an earthquake which spreads over an area the radius of
    which is great as compared with its depth.</p>

  <p>To find the mean acceleration of an earth particle, which quantity
    has been taken to represent intensity, during any simple backward or
    forward motion of the earth, it will be first necessary to determine
    the amplitude of this motion and its maximum velocity, the mean
    acceleration being equal to
    <span class="frac"><sup><span class="smcap">v</span><sup>2</sup></sup><span>/</span><sub>2<span class="smcap">a</span></sub></span>.</p>

  <div class="figright">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The second and third movements in a shock invariably exhibited the
    greatest intensity, and to a distance of 400 feet from the origin,
    where about three pounds of dynamite had been exploded in a bore-hole
    about six feet deep, these intensities decreased directly as the
    distance from the origin. The less intense movements also decreased
    directly as the distance from the origin to a certain point, but after
    that they decreased more slowly. A mean result of the more prominent
    vibrations in four sets of experiments is shown in the curve, fig. 12,
    where the horizontal measurements
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> represent distance from the origin
    in feet, and the vertical measurements mean acceleration in thousands
    of millimetres per second.</p>

  <p>This curve approximates to an equi-angular hyperbola. The area between
    the curve and its asymptotes is proportional to the whole energy of
    the shock. The area of the diagram is proportional to the energy given
    up to the ground by the explosion of three pounds of dynamite. If we
    call the unit shock the effect produced by the explosion of one pound
    of dynamite, the above artificial earthquake had an intensity equal to
    three.</p>

  <p>The only other investigations which have been made in this interesting
    branch of observational seismology are those by Mr. Robert Mallet,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
    and those by General Henry L. Abbot.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p><em>Mallet’s Results.</em>—The velocity with which earth vibrations were
    transmitted as deduced by Mr. Mallet were as follows:—</p>

  <p>A striking result which was obtained by Mallet in his experiments at
    Holyhead was that the transit velocity increases with an increase in
    the intensity of the initial shock. Thus with a charge of 12,000 pounds
    of powder the transit rate was 1,373 feet per second, whilst with 2,100
    pounds the transit rate was 1,099 feet per second. In these experiments
    tremors were observed as preceding and following the main shock.</p>

  <p>A seismometer of type A means that the telescope used in observing the
    tremor produced on the surface of a vessel of mercury by the passage of
    the shock had a magnification of 6, whilst a telescope of the type B
    had a magnification of 12.</p>

  <p>The mean velocity given by six observations with type A is 4,225 feet
    per second, while that given by the same number with type B is 7,475
    feet per second.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>If we assume that the first tremor observed in the mercury is to
    determine the true rate of transmission, General Abbot tells us that we
    must reject all observations made with type A, inasmuch as they do not
    reveal the velocity of the leading tremor. However, he also tells
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> us
    that a still higher power above 12 might have detected still earlier
    tremors.</p>

  <p>When gunpowder was the explosive, the observers noted that the
    disturbance observed in the mercury took a much longer time to reach a
    maximum than it did when dynamite was employed.</p>

  <p>It was also observed that explosions fired beneath deep water gave
    a higher velocity than similar explosions which took place beneath
    shallow water. In the latter case much of the energy was probably
    expended in throwing a jet of water into the air.</p>

  <p>Another point which was observed appears to have been that the rate
    varied with the initial shock. Thus:—</p>

  <p>General Abbot’s general conclusions are:—</p>

  <p>1. A high magnifying power of telescope is essential in seismometric
    observations.</p>

  <p>2. The more violent the initial shock the higher is the velocity of
    transmission.</p>

  <p>3. This velocity diminishes as the general wave advances.</p>

  <p>4. The movements of the earth’s crust are complex, consisting of many
    short waves first, increasing and then decreasing in amplitude; and
    with a detonating explosive the interval between the first wave and
    the maximum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
    wave, at any station, is shorter than with a slow burning
    explosive.</p>

  <p>The general results to be deduced from the above appear to be:—</p>

  <p class="hang1">1. For vertical motion.</p>

  <p class="hang2">(<i>a</i>) For the first 200 feet. The velocity depends upon the initial
    force—the greater the charge of dynamite the greater the velocity.</p>

  <p class="hang2">(<i>b</i>) For the second 200 feet. The above law only appears in
    experiments IV. and V., but it must be remembered that the origins
    of I. and III. were farther removed from A than IV. and V.</p>

  <p class="hang1">The speed of the wave during the second 200 feet is always less
    than during the first 200 feet.</p>

  <p class="hang1">2. For normal vibrations.</p>

  <p class="hang2">Here the speed between A and C is all that was measured, but we
    again see that the greater the initial force, or the nearer we are
    to the origin of the disturbance, the greater is the velocity. This
    velocity is greater than the velocity of the vertical or transverse
    vibrations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

  <p class="hang1">3. For transverse vibrations.</p>

  <p class="hang2">If we assume that the vertical vibrations are a component of the
    transverse motions we see the same law as before—namely, that the
    nearer we are to the origin of the disturbance the greater is the
    speed with which that disturbance is propagated.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that the chief law here enunciated respecting the
    decrease in speed of earth vibrations is the same as that pointed
    out by General Abbot, from which it only differs by its being in all
    cases proved without the introduction of personal errors, for the same
    explosion, along the same line of ground and for different kinds of
    vibrations.</p>

      <span class="subhead">EARTHQUAKE MOTION AS DEDUCED FROM OBSERVATION ON EARTHQUAKES.</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <div class="summary">
    Result of feelings—The direction of motion—Instruments as
    indicators of direction—Duration of an earthquake—Period of

    motion—Intensity of earthquakes—Velocity and acceleration of an
    earth particle—Absolute intensity of an earthquake—Radiation of an
    earthquake—Velocity of propagation.</div>

  <p><em>Result of Feelings.</em>—As the result of our experiences, and by
    observations upon the movements produced in various bodies, we can
    say that an ordinary earthquake consists of a number of backward and
    forward motions of the ground following each other in quick succession.
    Sometimes these commence and die out so gently that those who have
    endeavoured to time the duration of an earthquake have found it
    difficult to say when the shock commenced and when it ended. This was
    a difficulty which Mr. James Bissett in Yokohama, and the author in
    Tokio, had to contend against when, in 1878, they commenced to time
    shocks between these two places.</p>

  <p>Sometimes these motions gradually increase to a maximum and then die
    out as gradually as they commenced.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the maximum comes suddenly, and at other times during an
    earthquake our feelings distinctly tell us that there are several
    maxima.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

  <p>These have been the experiences of many observers, and have been
    recorded by writers since the earliest times. Mallet devotes a
    chapter to a consideration of the tremulous motion that precedes and
    follows a shock, and he tells us that a single shock is an absolute
    impossibility. In speaking of earthquakes, he says: ‘The almost
    universal succession of phenomena recorded in earthquakes is, first a
    trembling, then a severe shock, or several in quick succession, and
    then a trembling gradually but rapidly becoming insensible.’</p>

  <p>A quantitative and exact knowledge of the nature of earthquake
    motion has only been attained of late years. The chief results which
    investigators have aimed at have been the measurement of the amplitude,
    the period, the direction, and the duration of the motions which
    constitute an earthquake. Attention has also been given to the velocity
    with which a disturbance is propagated.</p>

  <p><em>The Direction of Motion.</em>—One of the most ordinary observations
    which are made about an earthquake is its direction. If we were to
    ask the inhabitants of a town which had been shaken by an earthquake
    the direction of the motion they experienced, it is not unlikely that
    their replies would include all the points of the compass. Many,
    in consequence of their alarm, have not been able to make accurate
    observations. Others have been deceived by the motion of the building
    in which they were situated. Some tell us that the motion had been
    north and south, whilst others say that it was east and west. A certain
    number have recognised several motions, and amongst the rest there will
    be a few who have felt a wriggling or twisting. Leaving out exceptional
    cases, the general result obtained from personal observation as to
    the direction of an earthquake of moderate intensity is extremely
    indefinite, and the only satisfactory information
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> to be obtained is
    that derived from instruments or from the effects of the earthquake
    exhibited in shattered buildings and bodies which had been overturned
    or projected.</p>

  <p>By the direction in which walls, columns, and other objects had been
    overthrown or fractured, Mallet was enabled to determine the position
    of the origin of the Neapolitan earthquake. Similar phenomena have many
    times been taken advantage of by other investigators of earthquake
    phenomena. Effects produced upon structures are, however, only to be
    observed as the results of a destructive earthquake, at which time
    cities may be regarded as collections of seismometers. (<em>See</em> chapter
    on Effects in Buildings.)</p>

  <p>To determine the direction of movement during a small earthquake, the
    most satisfactory method appears to be an appeal to instruments.</p>

  <p><em>Instruments as Indicators of Direction.</em>—The relative values of
    different kinds of instruments, such as columns, pendulums, and the
    like, as indicators of direction have already been discussed.</p>

  <p>By the use of pendulum seismographs it has been shown that during an
    earthquake the ground may move in one, two, or several directions (see
    <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>); and it is, generally speaking, only in those cases where we
    experience a decided shock in the disturbance that we can determine
    with any confidence the direction in which the motion has been
    propagated. Such directions are usually indicated by the major axis of
    certain more or less elliptical figures which have been drawn, which
    in themselves appear to indicate the combination of two rectilinear
    movements.</p>

  <p>Results similar to those indicated by the records of pendulum
    seismographs have also been obtained upon moving plates with a double
    bracket seismograph. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
    in the earthquake which shook Tokio at 6
    <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on July 5, 1881, there were indications of the following
    motions:—</p>

  <p>Near the commencement of the shock the motion was N. 112° E. One and a
    half second after this, the direction of motion appears to have been
    N. 50° E. In three-fourths of a second more it gradually changed to a
    direction N. 145° E., and after a similar interval to N. 62° E. Half a
    second after this it was N. 132° E., and four seconds later the motion
    was again in the original direction—namely, N. 112° E.</p>

  <p>These particular directions of motion have been selected because they
    were so definitely indicated.</p>

  <p>The commonest type of earthquake which is experienced in Japan, and
    probably also in other earthquake-shaken districts, is the compound or
    diastrophic form.</p>

  <p>That earthquakes often have motions compounded of two sets of
    vibrations, has also been proved by the analysis of the records
    obtained from two component seismographs. From an analysis of a record
    of this description, Professor Ewing has shown that in the earthquake
    felt in Tokio on March 11, 1881, there were approximate circular
    (somewhat spiral) movements.</p>

  <p>This leads us to the consideration of the twisting and wriggling
    motions which are said to be experienced by some observers. Motions
    like these, which by the Italians and Mexicans are called <i xml:lang="es">vorticosi</i>,
    are usually supposed to be the cause of objects like chimneys and
    gravestones being rotated. These phenomena, it will be seen from what
    is said in the chapter upon the effects produced in buildings, can be
    more easily explained upon the supposition of a simple rectilinear
    movement.</p>

  <p>That at the time of an earthquake there may be motion in more than one
    direction has been recognised since the time of Aristotle; and it is
    possible that two sets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
    of rectilinear motion, as, for instance, the
    normal and transverse movements, may have led observers to imagine that
    there has been a twisting motion taking place, and this especially when
    the two sets of movements have quickly succeeded each other.</p>

  <p>Persons inside flexible buildings may possibly have experienced more
    or less of a rotatory motion, although the shock was rectilinear; the
    building assuming such a motion in consequence of its construction and
    its position with regard to the direction of the shock.</p>

  <p>In the case of destructive earthquakes, especially at points situated
    practically above the origin, the universal testimony, Mallet tells
    us, is that a twisting, wriggling motion in different planes, attended
    by an up-and-down movement of greater range, is experienced. To such
    disturbances the word <i xml:lang="es">sussultatore</i> is sometimes applied. Mallet has
    given many elliptical and other closed curves to illustrate the nature
    of such motions.</p>

  <p><em>Duration of an Earthquake.</em>—When reading accounts of earthquakes
    it is often difficult to determine the length of time a shaking was
    continuous. In Japan, in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 745, there was a shaking which
    is said to have lasted sixty hours; and in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 977 there were
    a series of shakings lasting 300 days. Often we meet with records of
    disturbances which have lasted from twenty to seventy days.</p>

  <p>At San Salvador, in 1879, more than 600 shocks were felt within ten
    days; in 1850, at Honduras, there were 108 shocks in a week; in 1746,
    at Lima, 200 shocks were felt in twenty-four hours; at the island of
    St. Thomas, in 1868, 283 shocks were felt during about ten hours.</p>

  <p>Disturbances like these, which succeed each other with sufficient
    rapidity to cause an almost continual trembling in the ground, may be
    regarded as collectively forming one great seismic effort which may
    last a minute, an hour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
    a day, a week, or even several years. Strictly
    speaking, they are a series of separate earthquakes, the resultant
    vibrations of which more or less overlap. Whenever a large earthquake
    occurs it is generally succeeded by a large number of smaller shocks.</p>

  <p>The seismic disturbance as regards time is, as Mallet remarks, very
    often ‘like an occasional cannonade during a continuous but irregular
    rattle of musketry.’ In the New Zealand earthquake of 1848, shocks
    continued for nearly five weeks, and during a large portion of the time
    there were at least 1,000 shocks per day.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>The earthquake of Lisbon, which in five minutes destroyed the whole
    town, was followed by a series of disturbances lasting over several
    months. After Basle had, on October 18, 1356, been laid in ruins,
    it is stated shocks followed each other for a period of a year. The
    Calabrian earthquake was continued with considerable strength for a
    year, and it is said that the earth did not come completely to rest for
    ten years. During this cannonade the heavy shocks announced, as they
    do in most earthquake countries at the present day, a series of weaker
    disturbances. In certain exceptional cases this order of events has
    been inverted, and slight shocks have announced the coming of heavy
    ones. Fuchs gives an example of this in the earthquake of Broussa, when
    the first shock was on February 28, 1855. On March 9 and 23 there were
    heavier shocks, but the heaviest did not arrive until March 28.</p>

  <p>Under certain conditions it is possible to have a sensible vibration
    produced in the ground which is practically of unlimited duration;
    thus, for instance, it has been noticed that the falling of water
    at certain large waterfalls, by its continuous rhythmical impact on
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
    rocks, produces in them tremors which are to be observed at
    great distances. Of this the author convinced himself at the Falls
    of Niagara, where he observed the reflected and ever-moving image of
    the sun in a pool of water. Under favourable circumstances almost
    continual condensation of steam might take place in volcanic foci, each
    condensation giving rise to a blow sufficiently powerful to produce
    vibrations in the surrounding ground. Those who have stood near a large
    geyser, like the one in Iceland, when it makes an ineffectual effort
    to erupt, will recognise how powerful such a cause might be. Humboldt
    has remarked shocks on Vesuvius and Pichincha which were periodic,
    occurring twenty to thirty seconds before each ejection of vapour and
    ashes.</p>

  <p>Earthquakes like these may be of vast extent, gradually spreading
    further and further outwards. This spreading of earth vibrations may
    be observed at a large factory containing heavy machinery or a steam
    hammer. After the machinery comes to rest, it is probably some time
    before the ground returns to rest. Examples of disturbances of this
    nature are spoken of under the head of Earth Tremors.</p>

  <p>The record of the duration of an ordinary earthquake as observed at a
    given point is dependent upon the sensibility of our instruments.</p>

  <p>Continuous motions perceptible to our senses without the aid of
    instruments usually last from thirty seconds to about two or three
    minutes. In Japan the shocks, as timed by watches, usually last from
    twenty to forty seconds. Occasionally a continuous shaking is felt for
    more than one and a half minutes, and cases have been recorded where
    the motion has continued for as much as four minutes and thirty-three
    seconds.</p>

  <p>Seismometers having a multiplication of 6 to 12
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> usually indicate that
    motion continues longer than is perceptible to the senses.</p>

  <p><em>Period of Vibration.</em>—When an earthquake contains several prominent
    vibrations which might be called the <em>shocks</em> of the disturbance, our
    feelings tell us that these have occurred at unequal intervals.</p>

  <p>About the time which is taken for the complete backward and forward
    oscillation of the ground which constitutes the shock a little has
    already been said. This was deduced from the records of disturbances as
    drawn by seismographs. From the same sources we can readily obtain the
    period of all the prominent vibrations in a disturbance.</p>

  <p>In any given earthquake there are irregularities in period, and
    different earthquakes differ from each other. About the early attempts
    to determine the period of earth vibrations something has been said in
    the chapter on Earthquake Instruments.</p>

  <p>In the earthquake of March 11 (referred to on <a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>) we find that both
    components commenced with a series of small vibrations, about five or
    six to the second; next came the shock, consisting of two complete
    vibrations executed in two seconds. In this it is to be observed that
    the motion eastwards was performed much more quickly than the motion
    westwards. Next, by reference to the east and west component, it is
    seen that there are a number of large vibrations, about one per second,
    on which a number of smaller motions are superposed. As the motion
    proceeds, these become less and less definitely pronounced and more
    irregular in their intervals, until finally the motion dies away.</p>

  <p>This earthquake, as recorded at the author’s house in Tokio, lasted
    about one and a half minute.</p>

  <p>The same earthquake, as recorded by Professor Ewing
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> at a station
    situated about one and a half mile distant, but on flat ground, appears
    to have lasted four and a half minutes. The largest wave had a period
    of 0·7 second.</p>

  <p>In the earthquake of March 8, 1881, there were on an average 1·4
    vibrations per second. These vibrations were executed in a direction
    transverse to the line joining the observing station and the locality
    from which the disturbance must have originated as determined by time
    observations. It can, therefore, be assumed that these vibrations,
    having so slow a period, were transverse motions, this slowness or
    sluggishness being due to the fact that the modulus for distortion
    is less than the modulus which governs the propagation of normal
    vibrations.</p>

  <p><em>The Amplitude of Earth Movements.</em>—In making estimates of the
    distances through which we are moved backward and forward at the time
    of an earthquake, if we judge by our feelings, we may often be misled.
    If a person is out of doors and walking, an earthquake may take place
    sufficiently strong to cause chimneys to fall and unroof houses, which,
    so far as the actual shaking of the ground is concerned, will be passed
    by unnoticed. On the other hand, to persons indoors, especially on an
    upper story, it is impossible even for a tremor to pass by without
    creating considerable alarm by the angular movement that has been taken
    up by the building.</p>

  <p>Many observers have endeavoured to make actual measurements of the
    maximum extent through which the earth moves at the time of an
    earthquake. Among the reports of the British Association for 1841 is
    the report of a committee which had been appointed ‘for obtaining
    instruments and registers to record shocks of earthquakes in Scotland
    and Ireland’. We read that in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
    earthquake which had been measured
    the displacement of the ground had been half an inch, and in another
    it had been less than half an inch. The instruments used to make these
    observations depended upon the inertia of pendulums which at the time
    of the disturbance were supposed to remain at rest. Observations
    similar to these have been made in Japan. One long series were made by
    Mr. E. Knipping for Dr. Gr. Wagener. They extended from November 1878
    to April 1880, and were as follows:—</p>

  <table summary="Earthquake amplitude">
    <tr>
      <th>Number of<br />Earthquakes</th>
      <th>Maximum horizontal<br />motion of the ground</th>
    </tr>

      <td>2·5&nbsp; &nbsp; „&nbsp; more &nbsp; „</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>With his apparatus for vertical motion Dr. Wagener also made
    observations on the absolute vertical motion. This seldom reached ·02
    mm. The greatest value was that observed for the destructive shock of
    Feb. 22, 1880, which was ·56 mm.</p>

  <p>By means of a number of instruments distributed at various localities
    round Tokio, the chief of which were pendulums with friction pointers
    to render them ‘<em>dead beat</em>,’ and with magnifying apparatus to show
    the actual motion of the ground, the author arrived at results similar
    to those obtained by Dr. Wagener—namely, that the earth’s maximum
    horizontal motion at the time of a small earthquake was usually only
    the fraction of a millimetre, and it seldom exceeded three or four
    millimetres. When we get a motion of five or six millimetres, we
    usually find that brick and stone chimneys have been shattered.</p>

  <p>The results obtained for vertical motion were also very small. In Tokio
    it is seldom that vertical motion can be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> detected, and when it is
    recorded it is seldom more than a millimetre.</p>

  <p>These results, which were put forward some years ago, have since
    received confirmation by the use of a variety of instruments in the
    hands of different observers.</p>

  <p>Mallet, in his account of the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857,
    approximated to the amplitude of an earth particle by observing the
    width, at the level of the centre of gravity, of fissures formed
    through and remaining in great masses of very inelastic masonry.</p>

  <p>Taking stations situated on or very nearly on the same line passing
    through the seismic vertical (<em>epicentrum</em>), Mallet observed the
    amplitude increased as some function of the distance, as will be seen
    from the following table:—</p>

  <table id="amplitude2" summary="Earthquake amplitude per distance">
    <tr>
      <th>Station</th>
      <th>Polla</th>
      <th>La Sala</th>
      <th>Certosa</th>
      <th>Tramutola</th>
      <th>Sarconi</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="tdl bl br">Distance from Seismic Vertical in geographical miles</td>
      <td class="br">3·45</td>

      <td class="br bb">&nbsp; 4·75</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The possibility of a law such as this having an existence for places at
    a distance from the seismic vertical comparable with the vertical depth
    of the centrum will be shown farther on.</p>

  <p>With regard to the maximum displacement of an earth particle. Mallet
    was of opinion that there was evidence to show that it had in some
    cases been over one foot. M. Abella, in an earthquake which occurred in
    the Philippines in 1881, made a rough observation of the motion of the
    earth to a distance of about <em>two metres</em>. This, as might be expected,
    was beyond the elastic limits of the material, and caused fissures to
    be formed, which were seen to open and shut.</p>

  <p><em>Intensity of Earthquakes.</em>—In speaking of the strength
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> of an
    earthquake, we usually employ terms like ‘weak,’ ‘strong,’ ‘violent,’
    &amp;c. Although these expressions, accompanied by illustration of the
    effects which an earth quake has produced, convey a general idea of
    the strength of a shock as felt at some particular locality, our ideas
    nevertheless wanting in definiteness; and if we endeavour to compare
    one shock with another, as a whole, our want of exactness is augmented.
    We have seen that Palmieri’s seismograph indicates intensity by a
    certain number of degrees, which, to a certain extent, is a measure of
    the violence of the motion as indicated at a particular locality. The
    degrees, as before stated, refer to the height to which in consequence
    of the shaking, a certain quantity of mercury was washed in a tube,
    which is a function of the depth of mercury in the tube, and also of
    the duration of the disturbance.</p>

  <p>From this it seems possible that a very slow motion of small amplitude,
    continuing over a sufficient period of time, might, if it agreed with
    the period of the mercury, indicate an earthquake of many degrees of
    intensity, whilst residents in the neighbourhood might not have noticed
    the disturbance; and, on the other hand, a short but intense shock
    creating considerable destruction might have been recorded as of only a
    few degrees of intensity.</p>

  <p>Although objections like these might be raised to such a method of
    recording intensity, in practice it would appear that such results are
    not pronounced, and the indications of the instrument usually give us
    approximate indications of relative intensity.</p>

  <p>In writing about the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857, Mallet says that
    ‘area alone affords no test of seismic energy.’</p>

  <p>The area over which a shock is felt will depend not only upon the
    initial force of the disturbance, but also
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> upon the focal depth of
    a shock, the form and position of that focus, the duration of the
    disturbance, and the nature and arrangement of the materials which are
    shaken.</p>

  <p>From observations in Japan, it is clearly shown that massive mountain
    ranges exert a considerable influence upon the extension of seismal
    disturbances. On one side of a large range of mountains large cities
    might be laid in ruins, whilst on the other side the disturbance
    creating this destruction might not be noticed.</p>

  <p><em>Velocity and Acceleration of an Earth Particle.</em>—We now pass on to
    methods of determining the intensity of an earthquake which are less
    arbitrary than those which have just been discussed. These methods have
    already been discussed when speaking of artificial disturbances, where
    it was shown that the intensity of an earthquake as measured by its
    destructive effects greatly depended upon the suddenness with which the
    backward and forward motions of the ground were commenced or ended.</p>

  <p>Amongst the earlier investigators of seismic phenomena who observed
    that there existed a connection between the distance to which bodies
    had been projected during an earthquake and the suddenness or initial
    velocity with which the ground had been moved beneath them, was
    Professor Wenthrop of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who noted that bricks
    from his chimneys had, by the New England earthquake of 1755, been
    thrown thirty feet. From this and the known height of the chimney, he
    calculates that the bricks had been projected with an initial velocity
    of twenty-one feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>The calculations made by Mallet respecting the maximum velocity of
    an earth particle at the time of the Neapolitan earthquake in 1857
    depended upon the overthrow, projection, and fracture of bodies.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

  <p>The principles which guided him in making the calculations will be
    understood from the following illustration.</p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/i_p080.jpg" width="262" height="273" alt="" />

  <p>If a column, <span class="smcap">a b c d</span>, receive a shock or be suddenly moved in
    the direction of the arrow, the centre of gravity, <span class="smcap">g</span>, of this
    column will revolve round the edge, and tend to describe the path <span class="smcap">g o</span>.
    If it passes <span class="smcap">o</span>, the column will fall. The work done in
    such a case as this is equal to lifting the column through the height
    o <i>h</i>.</p>

  <p>If <span class="smcap">g a</span> = <i>a</i>, the angle <span class="smcap">g a</span> <i>h</i> = <i>ϕ</i>, and the
    weight of the body = <span class="smcap">w</span>, then the above work equals</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">w</span><i>a</i> (1 − cos <i>ϕ</i>).</p>

  <p>This must equal the work acquired—that is to say, the kinetic energy of
    rotation of the body, or</p>

  </p>

  <p>Mallet finds these values for the cube, solid and hollow rectangular
    parallelopipeds, solid and hollow cylinders, &amp;c. In these formulæ we
    have a direct connection between the dimensions and form of a body and
    the velocity with which the ground must move beneath it to cause its
    overthrow.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Not only is the case discussed for horizontal forces, but also for
    forces acting obliquely. Similar reasonings are applied to the
    productions of fractures in walls, but as there is uncertainty in our
    knowledge of the co-efficient of force necessary to produce fracture
    <em>through joints across</em> beds of masonry, the deductions ought not to
    be applied as the measures of velocity. Where the fractures occur at
    the base or in horizontal planes, or in those of the continuous beds of
    the masonry, or through homogeneous bodies, the uncertainty is not so
    great, and for cases like these Mallet gives several illustrations. The
    distance to which bodies had been projected, as, for example, ornaments
    from the tops of pedestals, coping-stones from the edges of roofs, were
    also used as means of determining the angle at which the shock had
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
    emerged, or, if this be known, for determining the velocity.</p>

  <p>Thus by a shock in the direction <span class="smcap">o c</span>, a ball, <span class="smcap">a</span>,
    on the top of a pedestal would describe a trajectory to the point
    <span class="smcap">c</span>. Let the angle which <span class="smcap">o c</span> makes with the horizon be

  <p>A serious error which may enter into calculations of this description
    when practically applied has been pointed out when speaking of columns
    as seismometers. It was then shown that such bodies before being
    overthrown may often be caused to rock, and therefore that their final
    overthrow may not have any direct connection with the impulse of the
    succeeding shock.</p>

  <p>Another point to which attention must be drawn respecting the above
    calculations is that if there was no friction or adherence between the
    projected body and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
    pedestal, in consequence of its inertia it
    would be left behind by the forward motion of the shock, and simply
    drop at the foot of its support. In the case of frictional adherence it
    would be carried forward by the velocity acquired before this adherence
    was broken, and thrown in a direction <em>opposite</em> to that given in the
    figure—that is to say, in the direction of the
    shock.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

  <p><em>The Absolute Intensity of the Force exerted by an Earthquake.</em>—No
    doubt it has occurred to many who have experienced an earthquake
    that the power which gave birth to such a disturbance must have been
    enormously great. The estimates which we shall make of the absolute
    amount of energy represented by an earthquake cannot, on account of the
    nature of the factors with which we deal, be regarded as accurate. They
    may, however, be of assistance in forming estimates of quantities about
    which we have at present no conception. One method of obtaining the
    result we seek is that which was employed by Mallet in his calculations
    respecting the Neapolitan earthquake. Although disbelieving in the
    general increment of temperature as we descend in the earth at an
    average rate of 1° F. for every fifty or sixty feet of descent, for
    want of better means. Mallet assumes this law to be true, and, knowing
    from a variety of observations the depth of various parts of the cavity
    from which the disturbance sprang, he calculates the temperatures of
    this cavity in various parts as due to its depth beneath the surface.
    Next, it is assumed that steam was suddenly admitted into this cavity,
    which might exert the greatest possible pressure due to the maximum
    temperature. This was calculated as being about 684 atmospheres.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

  <p>Next, he determined the column of limestone necessary to balance such a
    pressure, which is about 8,550 feet in height. As the least thickness
    of strata above this cavity was 16,700 feet, the pressure of 684
    atmospheres was not sufficient to blow away its cover, but if suddenly
    admitted or generated in the cavity it might have produced the wave of
    impulse by the sudden compression of the walls of the cavity.</p>

  <p>The pressure of 684 atmospheres is equivalent to about 4·58 tons on
    the square inch, and, as the total area of the walls of the cavity is
    calculated at twenty-seven square miles, the total accumulated pressure
    would be more than 640,528 millions of tons. Mallet, however, shows
    that it is probable that the temperature of the focal cavity was much
    greater than that due to the hypogeal increment, and that therefore the
    pressure may have been greater.</p>

  <p>The capability of producing the earthquake impulse, however, depends
    on the <em>suddenness</em> with which the steam is flashed off. According
    to the experiments of Boutigny and others, Mallet tells us that the
    most sudden production of steam would take place at a temperature of
    500°-550° C., which is but a few degrees below that calculated for the
    mean focal depth.</p>

  <p>Assuming the above calculated pressure to be true, and knowing the
    co-efficient of compression of the materials on which it acted, the
    volume of the wave at a given moment near the instant of starting—that
    is, at the focus—can be calculated, and from this the wave amplitude on
    reaching the surface may be deduced.</p>

  <p>Proceeding backwards, if we have observed the wave amplitude,
    calculated the depth of the focus, and know the co-efficient of
    expansion, then the total compression
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> may be calculated and the
    temperature due to the pressure producing this may be arrived at. In
    this way earthquakes may be used as a means of calculating subterranean
    temperature at depths that can never be attained experimentally.</p>

  <p>A method of proceeding which is probably more definite than that
    adopted by Mallet would be the application of the method indicated when
    speaking of the intensity of artificial disturbances.</p>

  <p>If for a given earthquake the origin of which is known we have
    determined by seismographs the mean acceleration of an earth particle
    at two or more stations at different distances from that origin, we are
    enabled to construct a curve of intensity the area between which and
    its asymptotes was shown to be a measure of the total intensity of the
    shock. Comparing this area with that of a unit disturbance produced,
    say, by the explosion of a pound of dynamite, one may approximately
    calculate in terms of this unit the initial intensity of the earthquake.</p>

  <p><em>Radiation of an Earthquake.</em>—The tremors preceding the more violent
    movements of an earthquake may be due, as Mallet has suggested,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
    to the free surface waves reaching a distant point before the direct
    vibrations.</p>

  <p>The fact that earth vibrations produced by striking a blow on or near
    the surface of the ground are wholly obliterated in reaching a cutting
    or valley, there being no underground waves of distortion to crop up
    on the opposite side of the valley, indicates that the disturbance is
    one that travels on the surface; the same fact is illustrated when we
    endeavour to transmit vibrations through the side of a hill into a
    tunnel.</p>

  <p>In the tunnel, although the distance may be small,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>no sensible effects
    are produced, whilst the same disturbance may be recorded at a long
    distance from its origin on the surface of the ground outside the
    tunnel.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we may refer to the experiences of miners underground.</p>

  <p>Occasionally it has happened that miners when deep underground, as in
    the Marienberg in the Saxon Erzgebirge, have felt shocks which have not
    been noticed on the surface. These observations are rare, and it is
    possible that they may be explained by the caving in of subterranean
    excavations.</p>

  <p>The usual experience is, that if a shock is felt underground it is also
    felt on the surface, as for example in the lead mines in Derbyshire at
    the time of the Lisbon disturbance (1755).</p>

  <p>The most frequent observation, however, is that a shock may be felt on
    the surface while it is not remarked by the miners beneath the surface,
    as at Fahlun and Presburg in November, 1823.</p>

  <p>At the Comstock Lode in Colorado about twelve years ago many
    earthquakes were felt. On one particular day twenty-four were counted.
    Superintendent Charles Foreman told the author when he visited Virginia
    City in 1882, that special observations were made to determine whether
    these shocks were felt as severely deep down in the mines as on the
    surface, where they were on the verge of being destructive. The
    universal testimony of many observers was that in most cases they were
    not felt at all underground, and when a shock was felt it was extremely
    feeble. At Takashima Colliery, in Japan, it is seldom that shocks are
    felt underground.</p>

  <p>The explanation of these latter observations appears to be either
    that, in consequence of a smaller amplitude
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> of motion in the solid
    rocks beneath the surface as compared with the extent of motion on
    the surface, the disturbances are passed by unnoticed, or else the
    disturbance is, at a distance from its origin, practically confined to
    the surface.</p>

  <p><em>Velocity of Propagation of an Earthquake.</em>—Although many have written
    upon earthquakes and have endeavoured to give to us the velocity with
    which they were propagated, the subject is one about which we have as
    yet but little exact information.</p>

  <p>The importance of this branch of investigation is undoubtedly great.
    By knowing the velocity with which an earthquake has travelled in
    various directions we are assisted in determining the locality of
    its origin; we may possibly make important deductions respecting the
    nature of the medium through which it has passed; perhaps also we
    may learn something regarding the intensity of the disturbance which
    created the earthquake. In the Report of the British Association for
    1851 Mallet gives the table on next page, in which are placed together
    the approximate rates of transit of shocks of several earthquakes
    which he discusses. Some of these, it will be observed, are records of
    disturbances which must have passed through or across the bed of the
    ocean.</p>

  <p>In Mallet’s British Association Report for 1858, he gives data compiled
    by Mr. David Milne<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> respecting the Lisbon earthquakes of 1755 and
    1761, from which data the tables of velocities <a href="#Page_89">(p. 89)</a> have been
    calculated, omitting those which Mr. Mallet has marked as uncertain.</p>

  <p>The distances are marked in degrees of seventy English miles each, and
    the time is reduced to Lisbon time.</p>

  <p>These tables, owing to the nature of the materials
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>which Mallet had at
    his disposal, are but rude approximations to the truth. Two interesting
    facts are, however, observable: the first being that the velocities
    for the earthquake of 1761 are much higher than those obtained for the
    earthquake of 1755; and, secondly, that in both cases the velocities as
    determined from the observations of ships at sea closely approximate
    to each other, in all cases being nearly the same as that with which a
    sound wave would travel through water.</p>

  <p>The great differences in transit velocity obtained for different
    earthquakes is a point worthy of attention.</p>

  <p>Seebach’s velocity is a <em>true</em> transit velocity, and its determination
    is dependent on the assumption that the shock radiated from the
    <em>centrum</em> and not from the <em>epicentrum</em>, Seebach’s method is explained
    when speaking about the determination of origins.</p>

  <p>Some interesting observations on the velocity with which the earthquake
    of October 7, 1874, was propagated, are given by M. S. di Rossi.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <p>One assumption is that the disturbance radiated from an origin
    to surrounding points of observation, whilst another is that the
    disturbance followed natural fractures, the direction of which is
    derived from the crest of certain mountain ranges. These velocities are
    as follows, Maradi being at or near the origin of the disturbance:—</p>

  <p>Another set of interesting results are those of P. Serpieri on the
    earthquake of March 12, 1873. The curious manner in which this shock
    radiated is described in the chapter on the Geographical Distribution
    of Earthquakes (see <a href="#Page_231">p. 231</a>). Two large areas appear to have been
    almost simultaneously struck, so that, there being no time for elastic
    yielding, the velocities calculated between places situated on either
    of the areas are exceedingly great.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p>The following are examples of approximate earthquake velocities which
    have been determined in Japan.</p>

  <p><em>The Tokio Earthquake of October 25, 1881.</em>—From records respecting
    this earthquake it appears to have been felt over the whole of Yezo
    and the northern and eastern coast of Nipon, a little farther south
    than Tokio. It was severest at Nemuro and Hakodate, and at the former
    place a little damage was done. From these facts, together with the
    indications of instruments recording direction of movement and a
    general inspection of the time records, it seems that the disturbance
    must have originated beneath the sea on the east coast of Yezo at a
    very long distance to the north-east of Tokio, from which place it
    passed in a practically direct line on to Yokohama.</p>

  <p>As the disturbance was felt at Yokohama twenty-one seconds later than
    at Tokio, and the distances between these two places is about sixteen
    geographical miles, for this portion of its course the disturbance must
    have travelled at a rate of at least 4,300 <em>feet per second</em>. If
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>we
    assume that the shock, after having reached Hakodate, travelled on at
    the same rate as it did between Tokio and Yokohama in order to reach
    Saporo, where the shaking was felt eighteen seconds after Hakodate,
    it must have had about thirteen geographical miles to travel after
    Hakodate was shaken before Saporo felt its effect.</p>

  <p>Drawing from Hakodate a tangent to the eastern side of a circle of
    thirteen miles radius described round Saporo, the origin of the
    disturbance must be on the line bisecting this tangent at right angles.
    As it also lies on a line drawn through Tokio and Yokohama, it lies in
    a position about 41 N. lat. and 144° 15′ E. long., which is a position
    somewhat nearer to Nemuro than Hakodate, as we should anticipate. If
    this be taken as approximately indicating the origin, then the shock,
    after reaching Hakodate from the Hakodate <em>homoseist</em>, travelled about
    218 miles to reach Tokio in 128 seconds, which gives a <em>velocity of
      10,219 feet per second</em>.</p>

  <p>The method here followed is equivalent to that of the hyperbola and one
    direction (see <a href="#Page_204">p. 204</a>). The hyperbola is described on the assumption
    that the velocity deduced from the time taken to travel between Tokio
    and Yokohama is correct, and also that the earth waves travelled with
    approximately the same velocity in the vicinity of Saporo as near
    Tokio. The probability, however, is that they travelled more quickly.
    If this be so, then the origin is thrown somewhat to the south-east and
    the velocity between the Hakodate homoseist and Tokio reduced. Thus,
    if the velocity in the Saporo district be double that observed in the
    Tokio district, the origin is shifted about twenty-eight miles to the
    south-west, and the last-mentioned velocity is reduced to about 9,000
    feet per second.</p>

  <p>If we work by the method of circles, and assume the velocity to have
    been constant in all directions, then this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> velocity must have been
    about 6,000 feet per second. If we assume that the indications of
    direction obtained from seismographs and other sources give to us by
    this intersection a proper origin, the velocity in some directions may
    have been as much as 17,000 feet per second.</p>

  <p>An origin thus determined, or even if determined by the method of
    circles, is in discord with the fact that places like Nemuro, in the
    north-east of Yezo, were nearer to the origin than any of the other
    places which have been mentioned.</p>

  <p>The conclusion which we are therefore led to with regard to this shock,
    assuming of course that the time observations are tolerably correct,
    is that the velocity of propagation was variable, being greater when
    measured between points near to the origin than between points at a
    distance. The velocities estimated vary between 4,000 and 9,000 feet
    per second.</p>

  <p>In the case of the earthquake which has just been discussed, we have
    an example of a disturbance which must have passed between Tokio and
    Yokohama in what was almost a straight line from the origin. As this
    direction ought to give the maximum time of transit if all earthquakes
    are propagated with the same velocity, the following table is given of
    the interval between the time of observation of several shocks at these
    two stations:—</p>

  <p>As these are observations which have been made with the assistance of a
    telegraphic signal daily employed to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> correct and rate the clocks from
    which the observations were obtained, they may be regarded as being
    tolerably, correct.</p>

  <p>The disturbance of February 6, the two shocks of March 1, appear, like
    that of October 25, to have passed in almost a direct line from an
    origin in the N.N.E, through Tokio on to Yokohama. Their velocities of
    propagation as calculated from the above intervals are approximately
    3,900, 1,900, and 1,400 feet per second. The shock of February 16
    appears to have had its origin near to a point in Yedo Bay about eight
    miles east of Yokohama. Assuming this to be the case, the shock between
    the Yokohama homoseist and Tokio travelled at the rate of 2,454 feet
    per second, but between the Tokio homoseist and Chiba at the rate
    of 750 feet per second; that is to say, the velocity of propagation
    rapidly decreased as the disturbance spread outwards.</p>

  <p>At Yokohama it was recorded at 5.31.54, at Tokio at 5.32.16, and at
    Chiba at 5.33.48. These times are given in Tokio mean time.</p>

  <p>The shock of March 11, which was recorded at Tokio at 7.51.22
    <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and at Yokohama at 7.51.33 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, appears, from
    the indications of instruments which were exceptionally definite in
    their records, to have originated in the N.E. corner of Yedo Bay,
    about nineteen miles S.S.W. from Chiba. This shock was rather severe,
    fracturing several chimneys. From the Tokio homoseist it appears to
    have travelled on to Yokohama at the rate of about 2,200 feet per
    second. Assuming these observations to be <em>approximately</em> accurate, if
    we take them with the records of previous observers they lead us to the
    following conclusions:—</p>

  <p>1. Different earthquakes, although they may travel across the same
    country, have very variable velocities,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> varying between several
    hundreds and several thousands of feet per second.</p>

  <p>2. The same earthquake travels more quickly across districts near to
    its origin than it does across districts which are far removed.</p>

  <p>3. The greater the intensity of the shock the greater is the velocity.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this
    chapter is, from a practical point of view, one
    of the most important with which a seismologist has to deal. We
    cannot prevent the occurrence of earthquakes, and unless we avoid
    earthquake-shaken regions, we have not the means of escaping from
    them. What we can do, however, is in some degree to protect ourselves.
    By studying the effects produced by earthquakes upon buildings of
    different construction and variously situated, we are taught how to
    avoid or at least to mitigate calamities which, in certain regions of
    the world, are continually repeated. The subject is an extensive one,
    and what is here said about it must be regarded only as a contribution
    to the work of future writers who may give it the attention it
    deservedly requires.</p>

  <p><em>The Destruction produced by Earthquakes is not irregular.</em>—If we
    were suddenly placed amongst the ruins of a large city which had
    been shattered by an earthquake, it is doubtful whether we should at
    once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
    recognise any law as to the relative position of the masses of
    <i xml:lang="fr">débris</i> and the general destruction with which we are surrounded.
    The results of observation have, however, shown us that, amongst the
    apparently chaotic ruin produced by earthquakes, there is in many cases
    more or less law governing the position of bodies which have fallen,
    the direction and position of cracks in walls, and the various other
    phenomena which result from such destructive disturbances.</p>

  <p>Mallet, at the commencement of his first volume, describing the
    Neapolitan earthquake of 1857, discusses the general effect produced by
    various shocks upon differently constructed buildings. First he shows
    that, if we have a rectangular building, the walls at right angles to
    the shock will be more likely to be overthrown than those which are
    parallel to it. Experience teaches a similar lesson. Thus Darwin, when
    speaking of the earthquake at Concepcion in 1835,<a id="FNanchor_20"
    href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> tells us that
    the town was built in the usual Spanish fashion, with all the streets
    running at right angles to each other. One set ranged S.W. by W. and
    N.E. by E. and the other N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. The walls in the
    former direction certainly stood better than those in the latter. The
    undulations came from the S.W.</p>

  <p>In Caraccas it is said that every house has its <i xml:lang="es">laga securo</i>, or safe
    side, where the inhabitants place their fragile property. This <i xml:lang="es">laga
    securo</i> is the north side, and it was chosen because about two out of
    every three destructive shocks traversed the city from west to east,
    so that the walls in these sides of a building have been stricken
    broadside on.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

  <p><em>Cracks in Buildings.</em>—Results like the above come from destructive
    earthquakes rather than from movements such as those we have to deal
    with ordinarily. When a building is subjected to a slight movement
    it is assumed that the walls at right angles to the direction of the
    shock move backwards and forwards as a whole, and there is little or
    no tendency for them to be fractured at their weaker parts, these
    weaker parts being those over the various openings. The walls, however,
    which are parallel to the direction of the movement are, so to speak,
    extended and contracted along their length, and in consequence they may
    be expected to give way over the various openings. This tendency for
    extension and contraction of a wall along its length may be supposed,
    for instance, to be due to the different portions of a wall, owing to
    differences in dimensions and elasticity, having different periods of
    natural vibration, or possibly for two portions of a long line of wall
    to be simultaneously affected by portions of waves in different phases.</p>

  <p>As an illustration of the giving way of a building in the manner here
    suggested we may take the case of a large brick structure which was
    recently being erected in Tokio. This building, at the time of the
    earthquake, was only some fourteen or fifteen feet above the surface
    of the ground. The length of the building stretched from N.W. to S.E.,
    and it was intersected by many walls at right angles to this direction.
    Through all the walls of this building there were many arched openings.
    In the central part of the transverse walls, which walls were fully
    five feet in thickness, the arches which joined them together were 4
    feet 4 inches in thickness. The arches therefore formed a comparatively
    lightly constructed link between heavy masses of brickwork.</p>

  <p>On March 3, 1879, at 4.43 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, an earthquake was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> felt
    throughout Tokio, the strength of which, as judged by our feelings,
    was above that of an average shock. As registered by one of Palmieri’s
    instruments, it had a direction S.S.W. to N.N.E. and an intensity of
    11°. On the same day there were several smaller shocks having the same
    direction, and these were succeeded by others on the 9th of the month.</p>

  <p>Immediately after these shakings it was discovered that almost every
    arch in the internal walls of the building here referred to had been
    cracked across the crown in a direction about N. 40° W. All the
    other arches of the building, of which there were a great number in
    walls at right angles to the direction of the shock, were found not
    to have sustained any injury. To this statement, however, there was
    one exception, which was subsequently proved to have been due to a
    settlement taking place.</p>

  <p>After examining these cracks the only cause to which they could be
    attributed was the series of shakings which they had just experienced.
    It seemed as if the heavy walls right and left of the arches had been
    in vibration without synchronism in their periods, and as a consequence
    the arches which connected them had been torn asunder.</p>

  <p>Although the time at which the cracks were formed and the peculiar
    positions in which they were only to be found pointed distinctly to
    their origin, to be certain that they were not due to settlement of the
    foundations, horizontal lines were ruled upon the brickwork and from
    time to time subsequently observed.</p>

  <p>The points to which the various cracks extended were also marked and
    observed. Beneath the walls as foundations there were beds of concrete
    about three feet thick and about ten feet in width. These had been
    under the pressure of the partially built walls for two years before
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
    the arches had been put in. As these foundations were unusually strong,
    being intended to carry so very much greater weight than that to which
    they had been subjected, if any settlement had been detected it would
    have been a matter of surprise.</p>

  <p>Some weeks after the formation of these cracks it was observed that
    they gradually closed. This was probably due to the gradual falling
    inwards of the two broken portions of the arch, their position when
    open being one of instability.</p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/i_p100.jpg" width="195" height="296" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—Cracks in a corner house,<br />Belluno, June 29, 1873
    (Bittner).</div>
  </div>

  <p>Had this building been more complete at the time of the shock, and
    the heavy walls been tied together at higher points, although the
    archways would have been points of weakness, it is quite possible
    that fracture would not have taken place. This illustration shows us
    that when a building is shaken in a definite direction there will be
    some rule as to the positions in which fractures occur. As another
    example, we may take the observations of Alexander Bittner upon the
    buildings of Belluno after the shock of June 29, 1873 (see Beiträge
    zur Kenntniss des Erdbebens von Belluno am 29 Juni, 1873, p. 40. Von
    Alexander Bittner. Aus dem LXIX. Bande der Sitzungsb. der K. Akad. der
    Wissensch., II. Abth., April-Heft. Jahrg. 1874).</p>

  <p>Speaking generally, he remarks that ‘Houses similarly situated have
    suffered in corresponding walls and corners in a similar manner. In
    Belluno there is a certain kind of damage which is repeated everywhere,
    making a peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
    system of splits in the S.W. and N.E. corners of the
    houses.’ This is well shown in the accompanying sketch, which evidently
    illustrates the effect of a shock oblique to the direction of two walls
    at right angles to each other.</p>

    fractures.</div>
  </div>

  <p><em>Buildings in Tokio.</em>—For the purpose of finding out what has been the
    effect produced by earthquakes upon the buildings of Tokio, and at
    the same time for ascertaining whether blocks of buildings ranging in
    different directions suffered to the same extent, the author examined,
    in company with Mr. Josiah Conder, a large number of foreign-built
    houses in the district of the Ginza. The chief reason for choosing
    this was because it was the only district where a large number of
    <em>similar</em> buildings could be found. By examining houses or buildings of
    different constructions, the effects produced upon them by earthquakes
    are very often likely to show so many differences that it becomes
    almost an impossibility to determine what the general effect has
    been—unsymmetrical construction involving unsymmetrical ruin.</p>

  <p>A number of similarly constructed buildings in one locality may be
    regarded as a number of seismographs, the effect upon any one of them
    being judged of by the average of the general effect which has been
    produced upon the whole. The general form of two of these houses
    which were examined is shown in fig. 17. In this figure
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> the general
    character of the fractures which have been produced can also be seen.
    The houses are built of brick, and are in many cases faced with a thin
    coat of white plaster. Projecting from the level of the upper floor
    there is a balcony fronted by a low balustrade. This is supported by
    small beams which at their outer extremity are carried on a row of
    cylindrical columns. This forms a covered way in front of each row of
    houses. The roofs are covered with thick tiles. It will be observed
    that the arches of the upper windows spring <em>sharply</em> from their
    abutments, and at their crown they carry a heavy key-stone. The lower
    openings, which have a span of 9 feet, have evidently been constructed
    in imitation of the open front of an ordinary Japanese house. These
    archways curve out <em>gently</em> from their abutments. The outside walls
    have a thickness of 13½ inches.</p>

  <p>The results obtained from a careful examination of 174 houses in
    streets running N.E. and 156 houses in streets running N.W., all of
    these houses being similar, were as follows:—</p>

  <p>1. In the upper windows nearly all the cracks ran from the springing,
    which formed an angle with the abutment.</p>

  <p>2. In the lower arches, which <em>curved</em> into the abutments, not a single
    crack was observed at the springway. The cracks in these arches were
    near the crown, where beams projected to carry the balcony. In many
    instances the cracks proceeded from such beams, even if there were
    no arch beneath. That cracks should occur in peculiar positions, as
    is here indicated, is shown in the illustrations which accompany the
    accounts of many earthquakes.</p>

  <p>3. The houses which were most cracked were in the streets running
    parallel to the direction in which the greater number and most powerful
    set of shocks cross the city.</p>

  <p>The results showed that, in order to avoid the effects of small shocks,
    all walls containing principal openings should be placed as nearly
    as possible at right angles to the direction in which the shocks of
    the districts usually travel. The blank walls, or those containing
    unimportant openings, would then be parallel to the direction of the
    shocks—that is, presuming our building to be made up of two sets of
    walls at right angles to each other.</p>

  <p>Another point of importance would be to build archways <em>curving</em> into
    the supporting buttresses; the archways over doors and windows which we
    find in earthquake countries do not appear to be in any way different
    from those which are built in countries free from earthquakes. In
    the one country these structures have simply to withstand vertical
    pressures applied statically; in the other, they have to withstand more
    or less horizontal stresses, applied suddenly.</p>

  <p><em>Relation of Destruction to Earthquake Motion.</em>—The relations which
    exist between the overturning and projection of bodies and the motion
    of the ground have already been discussed. It may be interesting
    to call attention to the fact that in the formulæ showing three
    relationships, it was the <em>shape</em> rather than the <em>weight</em> of a body
    which determined whether it should be overturned or projected by a
    motion at its base.</p>

  <p>As an interesting proof that light bodies may be overturned as easily
    as heavy ones. Mallet refers to the overturning of several large
    haystacks as one of the results of the Neapolitan earthquake.</p>

  <p>If masses of material are displaced or fractured, then Mallet remarks
    that the maximum velocity will exceed √<span class="sqrt3">2<i>gh</i></span>, where <i>h</i> is the
    amplitude of the wave. Should the maximum velocity be less than this
    quantity, the masses which are acted upon will be simply raised and
    lowered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
    and there will be no relative displacements even if the
    emergence of the wave be nearly or quite vertical.</p>

  <p>When we get a vertical wave acting upon an irregular mass of masonry,
    the heavier portions of the masonry, by their inertia, tend to descend
    relatively to the remaining portions, and in this way vertical fissures
    will be produced. For this reason it would not be advisable to use
    heavy materials above archways, heavy roofs, or heavy floors. The
    vertical fissures, Mallet remarks, would have their widest opening at
    the base.</p>

  <p>In considering cases of fracture produced by earthquake motion, it
    must be remembered that these are due to stresses applied <em>suddenly</em>,
    and that if the same amount of stress had been <em>slowly</em> applied to a
    building, fractures might not have occurred.</p>

  <p>If a disturbance is horizontal, and has a direction parallel to the
    length of a wall, the wall is carried forward at its foundations. This
    motion is opposed by the inertia of the upper portion of the wall and
    the various loads it carries. The wall being elastic, distortion takes
    place, and cracks, which are widest at the top, will be formed. In a
    uniform wall the two most prominent fissures ought to be near the ends.</p>

  <p>If the horizontal backward and forward movement has a direction
    oblique to the plane of the wall, the wall will be either overthrown,
    fractured, or have a triangular fragment thrown off towards the origin
    from the end last reached.</p>

  <p>Should the wave emerge steeply, diagonal fissures at right angles to
    the direction of transit will be formed, or else triangular pieces will
    be projected.</p>

  <p>The accompanying figures are reduced from Mallet’s ‘Account of the
    Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857.’</p>

  <p>Taking <i>a b</i> as the general direction of the fractures in
    fig. 18, then <i>c d</i> will represent the direction in which the shock
    emerged, which is at an angle of 23°·20′ to the horizon. It might be
    argued that the direction of these fractures was due to the direction
    in which surface undulations had travelled, or to the relative
    strengths and proportions of different portions of the building. The
    directions of cracks in a building are undoubtedly due to a complexity
    of causes, but for buildings situated in the region of shock the
    impulsive effect of the shock is probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
    the most important function
    to be considered. The method of applying the directions of emergence,
    deduced from observations on fractures, to determine the origin of a
    disturbance will be referred to in Chapter X.</p>

    Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Mallet observed that, although two ends of a building might be nearly
    the same, the fissures and joints do not occur at equal distances from
    the ends, nor are they equally opened.</p>

  <p>The end where the joints are the most opened is that which was first
    acted upon, and this phenomenon may be sufficiently well pronounced
    to indicate the direction in which we must look to find the origin
    of a disturbance. Amongst possible explanations for this disposition
    of fractures in a wall. Mallet suggests that they may be due to real
    differences in the two semiphases of the wave of shock, the second
    semiphase being described with a somewhat slower velocity than the
    first. This, it will be observed, is contrary to the indications of
    seismographs.</p>

  <p>Fig. 19, of the cathedral at Paterno, shows the effect of a subnormal
    shock striking a wall obliquely and projecting one of its corners.</p>

  <h3>MEASUREMENTS OF THE RELATIVE MOTION OF PARTS OF A BUILDING AT THE TIME
    OF AN EARTHQUAKE.</h3>

  <p>In 1880 a series of observations was made in Tokio to determine whether
    at the time of an earthquake the various parts of the arched openings
    which we see in many buildings synchronised in their vibrations, or,
    for want of synchronism, were caused to approach and recede from each
    other. The arches experimented on were heavy brick arches forming the
    two corridors of the Imperial College of Engineering. The direction of
    one set of these corridors is N. 40° E. and that of the other N. 50° W.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>The thickness of the walls in which these arches are placed is 1 ft.
    11 in. They are built of Japanese bricks bound together with ordinary
    lime. The span of the arches is 8 ft. 3 in., and the height of the arch
    from the springing-line to the crown 4 ft. 1 in. The height of the
    abutments is 7 ft. 1½ in. The voussoirs of the arch are formed of a
    light grey soft volcanic rock, and on their faces show a depth of 12
    inches. The width of the intermediate columns between the arches is 4
    ft. 6⅞ in.</p>

  <p>To determine whether at the time of an earthquake there was any
    variation in the dimensions of these arches, a light stiff deal
    rod, about 2 in. by ½ in. in cross section, was placed across the
    springing-line of the arch. One end of this was firmly fixed to the
    top of one abutment by means of a spike; on the other end, which was
    to indicate any horizontal movement if the abutments approached each
    other, there was fixed a pointer made out of a piece of steel wire.
    This rested on a piece of smoked glass fixed to the ledge on which
    the loose end of the rod was resting. If the abutments approached or
    receded from each other a line would be drawn measuring the extent of
    the motion. As a further indication of motion, a second smoked glass
    plate was fixed on the transverse rod, which plate was marked on by a
    pointer attached to a vertical rod hanging down from the crown of the
    arch.</p>

  <p>As a general result of these experiments it may be said that the
    portions of the building which were examined usually either did not
    move at all, or else they practically synchronised in their movements.
    When they did move, the extent of motion was small, and the small
    differences in movement which were observed were in every probability
    far within the elastic limits of the structure.</p>

  <p><em>Observations on Cracks.</em>—To determine whether the walls of a building
    which have once been cracked, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
    subjected to a series of shocks,
    similar to those which they experienced before being cracked, still
    continued to give way, the extremities of a considerable number of
    cracks in the N.E. end of the museum buildings of the Engineering
    College were marked with pencil. Although since the time of marking
    there had been many severe shocks, these cracks did not visibly extend.
    These marks were made on the outside wall of the building. On the
    inside, one of these same cracks showed itself as a fissure about ¼
    inch in width. Across this crack a horizontal steel wire pointer was
    placed. One end of this wire was fixed in the wall; the other end,
    which was pointed, rested on the surface of a smoked glass plate placed
    on the other side of the crack. After small earthquakes there was no
    indication of motion having taken place, but after a shock on February
    21, as indicated by a line upon the smoked glass plate, it was seen
    that the sides of the crack had approached and receded from each other
    through a distance of about ¹/₁₆ inch.</p>

  <p>By similar contrivances placed on cracks in a neighbouring building
    exactly similar results were obtained, namely, that during small
    earthquakes the two sides of the crack had retained their relative
    positions, but at the time of a large shock this position had been
    changed.</p>

  <p>In this building it was also observed that the cracks in many instances
    increased their length.</p>

  <p>By attaching levers to the end of the pointers to multiply any motion
    that might take place, no doubt the indications would be more frequent
    and more definite. It would also be easier to note the relative
    distances of motion in two directions, namely, how far the cracks had
    closed and how far they had opened. As to whether motion would occur or
    not, much would no doubt depend upon the direction of the earthquake.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

  <p><em>Prevention of Fractures.</em>—One conclusion which may perhaps be drawn
    from these observations is, that a cracked building at the time of an
    earthquake shows a certain amount of flexibility. Whether a building
    which had been designed with cracks or joints between those parts
    which were likely to have different periods of vibration would be more
    stable, so far as earthquake shakings are concerned, than a similar
    building put up in an ordinary manner, is a matter to be decided by
    experiment. Certainly some of the cracks which have been examined
    indicate that if they had not existed, the strain upon the portion of
    the building where they occur would have been extremely great.</p>

  <p><em>Direction of Cracks.</em>—In looking at the cracks produced by small
    earthquakes it is interesting to note the manner of their extension.
    The basements of the buildings which have been most carefully examined
    are, for a height of two or three feet, built of large rectangular
    blocks of a greyish-coloured volcanic rock. In these parts the cracks
    pass in and out between the joints of the stone, indicating that
    the stones have evidently been stronger than the mortar which bound
    them together, and as a consequence the latter had to give way.
    Above this basement when the cracks enter the brickwork, they no
    longer exclusively confine themselves to the joints, but run in an
    irregular line through all they meet with, sometimes across the bricks
    and sometimes through the mortar joints. In places where they have
    traversed the brickwork, we can say that the mortar has been stronger
    than the bricks. This traversing of the bricks rather than the joints
    is, I think, the general rule for the direction of the cracks in the
    brickwork of Tokio buildings.</p>

  <p><em>The Pitch of Roofs.</em>—From observation of the effects
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> produced by
    earthquakes, it appears to us that the houses which lost the greater
    number of tiles appear to be those with the steepest pitch, and those
    where the tiles were simply laid upon the roof and not in any manner
    fastened down. It would seem that destruction of this sort might to a
    great extent be obviated by giving the roofs a less inclination and
    fixing the tiles with nails. It was also noticed that the greatest
    disturbance amongst the tiles was upon the ridges of the roofs.
    Destruction of this sort might be overcome by giving especial attention
    to these portions during the construction of the roof.</p>

  </div>

  <p><em>Relative Position of Openings in Walls.</em>—From what has been said about
    the fractures in the buildings of Tokio it will have been seen that,
    with but few exceptions, they have all taken place above openings
    like doorways and windows. If architecture demands that openings like
    arches should be placed one above another in heavy walls of this kind,
    as in fig. 17, there will be lines of weakness running through the
    openings parallel to the dotted lines. As arches are only intended
    to resist vertical thrusts, special construction must be adopted to
    make them strong enough to resist horizontal pulls. For instance, a
    flat arch would offer more resistance to horizontal pulls than an
    arch put together with ordinary voussoirs, there being in the former
    case more friction to prevent the component parts sliding over each
    other. Or again, above each arch an iron girder or wooden lintel might
    be inserted in the brick or stone arch. It was suggested to me by my
    colleague, Mr. Perry, that the best form calculated to give a wall
    uniform strength, would be to build it so that the openings of each
    tier would occupy alternate positions, that is to say, along lines
    parallel to the struts and ties of a girder. In this way we should have
    our materials so arranged that they would offer the same resistance to
    horizontal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
    as to vertical movements. Such a wall is shown in fig. 20:
    the dotted lines running through the openings, and all similar lines
    parallel to the former, representing lines of weakness. If we compare
    this with fig. 21, we shall see that in the case of a horizontal
    movement <i>a b</i> or of a vertical movement <i>c d</i>, we should rather expect
    to find fractures in a house built like fig. 21 than in one built
    like fig. 20. If, however, these two buildings were shaken by a shock
    which had an angle of emergence of about 45° in the direction <i>e f</i>,
    the effects might be reversed. Usually, however, and always in a town
    like Tokio which is visited by shocks originating at a distance, the
    movements are practically horizontal ones, and, therefore, buildings
    erected on the principles illustrated by fig. 20 should be much
    superior, so far as resisting earthquakes is concerned, to buildings
    constructed in the ordinary manner, as in fig. 21. Fractures following
    a vertical line of weakness are shown in the accompanying drawing,
    fig. 22, of the Church of St. Augustin, at Manilla, shattered by the
    earthquakes of 1880.</p>

  <p><em>The last House in a Row.</em>—When an earthquake shock enters a line
    of buildings, and proceeds in a direction coincident with that of
    the buildings, we should expect that the last of these houses, being
    unsupported on one side, would be in the position of the last person in
    Tyndall’s row of boys. From this it would seem that the end house in a
    row would show the greatest tendency to fly away from its neighbours.
    If the last house stood upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
    edge of a deep canal or a cliff,
    there would be a layer of ground, equal in thickness to the depth of
    the canal or to the height of the cliff, as the case may be, which
    would also be in a position to be thrown forward. The effect which is
    sometimes produced upon an end building is shown in fig. 23, which is
    taken from the photograph of a house shattered in 1868 at San Francisco.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

  <p><em>The Swing of Buildings.</em>—The distance through which buildings are
    moved at the time of an earthquake depends partly on their construction
    and partly on the extent, nature, and duration of the movement
    communicated to them at their foundations. By violent shocks buildings
    may be completely overthrown. In the case of small earthquakes, the
    upper portion of a house may frequently move through a much greater
    distance than the ground at its foundation. For instance, during the
    Yokohama earthquake of February, 1880, when the maximum amplitude of
    the earth’s motion was probably under ¾ of an inch, from the slow
    swing of long Japanese pictures, from three to six feet in length,
    which oscillated backwards and forwards on the wall, it is very
    probable that the extent through which the upper portion of houses
    moved was very considerable. In some instances these pictures seem to
    have swung as much as two feet, and from the manner in which they swung
    they evidently synchronised with the natural swing of the house.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p114.jpg" width="536" height="336" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>—Webber House, San Francisco.&nbsp; &nbsp; Oct. 21,
    1868.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

  <p>From this it would seem that such a house must have rocked from side to
    side one foot out of its normal perpendicular position. That the motion
    was great is testified by nearly all who tried to stand at the time of
    the shock, it having been impossible to walk steadily across the floor
    of a room in an upper story. The houses here referred to are either
    those which are purely Japanese, or else those which are framed of wood
    and built on European models, a class of building which is very common
    in Tokio and Yokohama.</p>

  <p>Perry and Ayrton calculated the period of a complete natural vibration
    of different structures. For a square house whose outer and inner
    sections were respectively 30 and 26 feet, and whose height was 30
    feet, the period calculated would be about ·06 second.</p>

  <p>At the time of the above earthquake many houses seem to have moved like
    inverted pendulums. On the morning after the shock my neighbour, who
    was living upstairs in a tall wooden house with a tile roof, told me
    that he endeavoured to count the vibrations, and was of the impression
    that to make a complete swing it took about 2 seconds.</p>

  <p>Assuming now that the distance through which the top of a wooden house
    moved was about 1 foot, and the number of vibrations which it made per
    second was about ·5, then the greatest velocity of a point on the top
    of such a house must have been about 6 feet per second.</p>

  <p>Mallet, who made observations upon the vibrations of various
    structures, tells us that Salisbury spire moves to and fro in a gale
    more than 3 inches. A well-constructed brick and mortar wall, 40 feet
    high and 1 foot 6 inches thick, was observed to vibrate in a gale 2
    feet transversely before it fell.</p>

  <p>An octagonal chimney with a heavy granite capping,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> 160 feet high, was
    observed instrumentally to vibrate at the top nearly 5 inches.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

  <p>At the time of a severe earthquake it does not seem impossible but that
    a building may be swung completely over. The accompanying illustration,
    fig. 24, taken from a photograph,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> apparently indicates a movement
    of description.</p>

      California.&nbsp; &nbsp; Oct. 21, 1868.</div>
  </div>

  <p><em>Principle of relative Vibrational Period.</em>—If a lath or thin pole
    loaded at one end with a weight fixed to the ground, so as to stand
    vertically, be shaken by an earthquake it will be caused to rock to
    and fro like an inverted pendulum. The period of its swing will be
    chiefly dependent on its dimensions, its elasticity, and its load. In
    a building we have to consider the vibration of a number of parts, the
    periods of which, if they were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
    independent of each other, would be
    different. On account of this difference in period, whilst one portion
    of a building is endeavouring to move towards the right, another
    is pulling towards the left, and, in consequence, either the bonds
    which join them or else they themselves are strained or broken. This
    was strikingly illustrated by many of the chimneys in the houses at
    Yokohama, which by the earthquake of February 20, 1880, were shorn off
    just above the roof. The chimneys were shafts of brick, and probably
    had a slower period of vibration than the roof through which they
    passed, this latter vibrating with the main portion of the house, which
    was framed of wood.</p>

  <p>A particularly instructive example of this kind which came under my
    notice is roughly sketched in fig. 25.</p>

  <div class="figright">
    <img src="images/i_p117.jpg" width="142" height="219" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>This is a chimney standing alone, which, for the sake of support, was
    strapped by an iron band to an adjoining building. It would seem that
    at the time of the shock, the building moving one way and the chimney
    another, the swing of the heavy building gave the chimney a sharp jerk
    and cut it off. The upper portion, being then loose upon the lower
    part, rotated under the influence of the oscillations in manner similar
    to that in which gravestones are rotated.</p>

  <p>Mallet made observations similar to these in Italy. He tells us that a
    buttress may often not have time to transmit its stability to a wall.
    The wall and the buttress have different periods of vibration, and
    therefore they exert impulsive actions on each other. Effects like
    these were strikingly observable in many of the rural
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> Italian churches
    where the belfry tower is built into one of the quoins of the main
    rectangular building.</p>

  <p>Not only have we to consider the relative vibrations of the various
    parts of a building amongst themselves, but we have to consider the
    relation of the natural vibrations of any one of them or the vibration
    of the building as a whole, with regard to the earth, the vibrations of
    which it must be remembered are not strictly periodic.</p>

  <p>Some of the more important results dependent upon the principle of
    ‘relative vibrational periods’ may be understood from the following
    experiments:—</p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/i_p118.jpg" width="258" height="155" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>In fig. 26 <span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, and <span class="smcap">c</span> are three flat
    springs made out of strips of bamboo, and loaded at the top with pieces
    of lead. At the bottom they are fixed into a piece of board <span class="smcap">d e</span>,
    and the whole rests on a table <span class="smcap">f g</span>. The legs of this
    table being slightly loose, by placing the fingers on the top of it, a
    quick short backward and forward movement can be produced. The weights
    on <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> are the same, but they are larger than
    the weight on <span class="smcap">c</span>. Consequently the periods of <span class="smcap">a</span> and
    <span class="smcap">b</span> are the same, but different to the period of <span class="smcap">c</span>.
    The dimensions of these springs are as follows: height, 18 inches;
    <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> each carry weights equal to 320 grammes, and
    they make one vibration per second; <span class="smcap">c</span> has a weight of 199
    grammes, and makes 0·75 vibrations per second.</p>

  <p><em>First Experiment.</em>—It will be found that by giving the table a gentle
    backward and forward movement, the extent of which movement may be
    so small that it will be difficult to detect it with the eye, either
    <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> may be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> made to oscillate violently whilst
    <span class="smcap">c</span> remains still; or <i xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>, <span class="smcap">c</span> may be caused to
    oscillate whilst <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> remain still. In the one
    case the period of shaking will have been synchronous with the natural
    period of <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span>, whilst in the latter it will have
    been synchronous with that of <span class="smcap">c</span>. This would seem to show us
    that if the natural period of vibration of a house, or of parts of
    it, at any time agree with the period of the shock, it may be readily
    thrown into a state of oscillation which will be dangerous for its
    safety.</p>

  <p><em>Second Experiment.</em>—Bind <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> together with a
    strip of paper pasted between them. (The paper used was three-eighths
    of an inch broad and would carry a weight of nearly three pounds.)
    If the table be now shaken as before, <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> will
    always have similar movements, and tend to remain at the same distance
    apart, and as a consequence the strip of paper will not be broken. From
    this experiment it would seem that so long as the different portions
    of a building have almost the same periods of vibration, there will be
    little or no strain upon the tie-rods or whatever contrivance may be
    used in connecting the different parts.</p>

  <p><em>Third Experiment.</em>—Join <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">c</span>, or <span class="smcap">b</span>
    and <span class="smcap">c</span> with a strip of paper in a manner similar to the last
    experiment. If the table be now shaken with a period approximating
    either to that of <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span>, or with that of
    <span class="smcap">c</span>, the paper will be suddenly snapped.</p>

  <p>This indicates that if we have different portions of a building of
    such heights and thicknesses that their natural periods of vibration
    are different, the strain upon the portions which connect such parts
    is enormous, and it would seem, as a consequence, that either the
    vibrators themselves, or else their connections, must, of a necessity,
    give way. This was very forcibly illustrated in the Yokohama
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
    earthquake of February 1880 by the knocking over of chimneys. The
    particular case of the chimneys is, however, better illustrated by the
    next experiment.</p>

  <p><em>Fourth Experiment.</em>—Take a little block of wood three-quarters of
    an inch square and about one inch high, and place it on the top of
    <span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, or <span class="smcap">c</span>. It will be found that, although
    the spring on which it stands is caused to swing backwards and forwards
    through a distance of three inches, the little block will retain its
    position.</p>

  <p>This little block we may regard as the upper part of a chimney standing
    on a vibrating stack, and we see that, so long as this upper portion is
    light, it has no tendency to fall.</p>

  <p><em>Fifth Experiment.</em>—Repeat the fourth experiment, having first placed a
    small leaden cap on the top of the block representing the chimney. (The
    cap used only weighed a few grammes.) When vibration commences it will
    be found that the block quickly falls. This would seem to indicate that
    chimneys with heavy tops are more likely to fall than light ones.</p>

  <p><em>Sixth Experiment.</em>—Bind <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> together with a
    strip of paper and stand the little block upon the top of either. It
    will be found that the block will stand as in the fourth experiment.</p>

  <p><em>Seventh Experiment.</em>—Bind <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">c</span>, or <span class="smcap">b</span>
    and <span class="smcap">c</span> together, and place the block upon the top of either of
    them. When vibration commences, although the paper may not be broken,
    the little block will quickly fall.</p>

  <p><em>Eighth Experiment.</em>—Take two pencils or pieces of glass tube and place
    them under the board <span class="smcap">d e</span>. If the table <span class="smcap">F G</span> be now
    shaken in the direction <span class="smcap">d e</span>, it will be found that the springs
    will not vibrate.</p>

  <p>In a similar manner if a house or portion of a house were carried on
    balls or rollers, as has already been suggested,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> it would seem that
    the house might be saved from much vibration.</p>

  <p><em>Ninth Experiment.</em>—Set any of the springs in violent vibration by
    gently shaking <span class="smcap">d e</span> instead of the table, and then suddenly
    cease the actuating motion. It will be observed that at the moment
    of cessation the board and the springs will have a sudden and very
    decided motion of translation in the same direction as that in which
    the springs were last moving, and although the springs were at the time
    swinging through a considerable arc, all motion will suddenly cease.</p>

  <p>This shows, that if a house is in a state of vibration the strain at
    the foundations must be very great.</p>

  <p>It would not be difficult to devise other experiments to illustrate
    other phenomena connected with the principle of relative vibrational
    periods, but these may perhaps be sufficient to show to those who have
    not considered this matter its great importance in the construction
    of buildings. Perhaps the greater portion of what is here said may by
    many be regarded as self-evident truisms hardly worth the trouble of
    demonstration. Their importance, however, seems to be so great that I
    hope that their discussion has not been altogether out of place.</p>

  <p>I may remark that in the rebuilding of chimneys in Yokohama the
    principles here enunciated were taken advantage of by allowing the
    chimneys to pass freely through the roofs without coming in contact
    with any of the main timbers.</p>

  <p>In putting up buildings to resist the effects of an earthquake, besides
    the idea of making everything strong because the earthquake is strong,
    there are several principles which, like the one just enunciated, might
    advantageously be followed which as yet appear to have received but
    little attention.</p>

  <p><em>Types of buildings used in earthquake countries.</em>—In Japan there
    are excellent opportunities of studying various types of buildings.
    The Japanese types, of course, form the majority of the buildings.
    The ordinary Japanese house consists of a light framework of 4 or
    5 inch scantling, built together without struts or ties, all the
    timbers crossing each other at right angles. The spaces are filled
    in with wattle-work of bamboo, and this is plastered over with mud.
    This construction stands on the top of a row of boulders or of square
    stones, driven into the surface soil to a distance varying from a few
    inches to a foot. The whole arrangement is so light that it is not an
    uncommon thing to see a large house rolled along from one position to
    another on wooden rollers. In buildings such as these after a series of
    small earthquake shocks, we could hardly expect to find more fractures
    than in a wicker basket.</p>

  <p>The larger buildings, such as temples and pagodas, are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> also built of
    timber. These are built up of such a multitude of pieces and framed
    together in such an intricate manner that they also are capable of
    yielding in all directions. The European buildings are, of course,
    made of brick and stone with mortar joints. Some of these, as the
    buildings of the Ginza in Tokio, are not designed for great strength.
    On the other hand, others have thick and massive walls and are equal in
    strength to those we find in Europe.</p>

  <p>The third type of buildings are those which are built in blocks; and
    these blocks being bound together with iron rods traversing the walls
    in various directions are especially designed to withstand earthquakes.
    A system somewhat similar to this has been patented in America, and
    examples of these so-called earthquake-proof buildings are to be found
    in San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Speaking of Japanese buildings, Mr. R. H. Brunton, who has devoted
    especial attention to them says that,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> ‘to imagine that slight
    buildings, such as are seen here (i.e. in Japan), are the best
    calculated to withstand an earthquake shock is an error of the most
    palpable kind.’ After describing the construction of a Japanese house
    in pretty much the same terms as we have used, he says ‘that with its
    unnecessarily heavy roof and weak framework it is a structure of all
    others the worst adapted to withstand a heavy shock.’ He tells us,
    further, that these views are sustained by the truest principles of
    mechanics. In order to render buildings to some extent proof against
    earthquakes, some of the heavy roofs in Tokio have been so constructed
    that they are capable of sliding on the walls. Mr. Brunton mentions
    a design for a house, the upper <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
    part of which is to rest on balls,
    which roll on inverted cups fixed on the lower part of the building,
    which is to be firmly embedded in the earth. A similar design was,
    at the suggestion of Mallet, used to support the tables carrying the
    apparatus of some of the lighthouses erected in Japan by Mr. Brunton.
    The very existence of these designs seems to indicate that the ordinary
    European house, however solidly and strongly it may be built, is not
    sufficient to meet the conditions imposed upon it. What is required,
    is something that will give way—an approximation to the timber frame
    of a Japanese house, so strongly condemned by Mr. Brunton and others.
    The crucial test of the value of the Japanese structure, as compared
    with the modern buildings of brick and stone, is undoubtedly to be
    found by an appeal to the buildings themselves. So far as my own
    experience has gone, I must say that I have never seen any signs in
    the Japanese timber buildings which could be attributed to the effects
    of earthquakes, and His Excellency Yamao Yozo, Vice Minister of Public
    Works, who has made the study of the buildings of Japan a speciality,
    told me that none of the temples and palaces, although many of them
    are several centuries old, and although they have been shaken by small
    earthquakes and also by many severe ones, show any signs of having
    suffered. The greatest damage wrought by large earthquakes appears to
    have resulted from the influx of large waves or from fires. In every
    case where an earthquake has been accompanied by great destruction,
    by consulting the books describing the same, it can be seen, from the
    illustrations in these books portraying conflagrations, that this
    destruction was chiefly due to fire. When we remember that nearly
    all Japanese houses are constructed of materials that are readily
    inflammable, it is not hard to imagine how destruction of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> this kind
    has come about. To a Japanese, living as he does in a house which has
    been compared to a tinder-box, fire is one of his greatest enemies,
    and in a city like Tokio it is not at all uncommon to see during the
    winter months many fires which sweep away from 100 to 500 houses. In
    one winter I was a spectator of three fires, each of which was said to
    have destroyed upwards of 10,000 houses.</p>

  <p>Although it would appear that the smaller earthquakes of Japan produce
    no visible effect upon the native buildings, it is nevertheless
    probable that small effects may have been produced, the observation
    of which is rendered difficult by the nature of the structure. If we
    look at buildings of foreign construction, by which are meant buildings
    of brick and stone, the picture before us is quite different, and
    everywhere the effects of earthquakes are palpable even to the most
    casual observer. Of these effects numerous examples have already been
    given. Not only are these buildings damaged by the cracking of walls
    and the overturning of chimneys, but they also appear to be affected
    internally. For instance, in the timbers of the roof of the museum
    attached to the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokio, there are a
    number of diagonal faces acting as struts or ties intended to prevent
    more or less horizontal movements taking place. Those which are rigidly
    joined together with bolts and angle irons have apparently suffered
    from their rigidity, being twisted and bent into various forms. The
    buildings in Tokio, which are strongly put together, being especially
    designed to withstand earthquakes, appear to have suffered but little.
    I know only one example which at the time of the severe shock of 1880
    had several of its chimneys damaged.</p>

  <p>The ordinary houses in Italy, though built of stone and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> mortar, are
    but poorly put together, and, as Mallet has remarked, are in no way
    adapted to withstand the frightful shakings to which they are subjected
    from time to time.</p>

  <p>In the large towns, like Naples, Rome, and Florence, where happily
    earthquakes are of rare occurrence, although the building may be
    better than that found in the country, the height of the houses and
    the narrowness of the streets are sufficient to create a shudder, when
    we think of the possibility of the occurrence of a moderately severe
    earthquake.</p>

  <p>In South America, although many buildings are built with brick
    and stone, the ordinary houses, and even the larger edifices, are
    specially built to withstand earthquakes. In Mr. James Douglas’s
    account of a ‘Journey Along the West Coast of South America,’ we read
    the following<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>: ‘The characteristic building material of Guayaquil
    is bamboo, which grows to many inches in thickness, and which, when
    cut partially through longitudinally at distances of an inch or so,
    and once quite through, can be opened out into fine elastic boards of
    serviceable width. Houses, and even churches, of a certain primitive
    beauty are built of such reeds, so bound together with cords that few
    nails enter into the construction, and which, therefore, yield so
    readily to the contortions of the earth during an earthquake as to be
    comparatively safe.’</p>

  <p>Here we have a house, which, so far as earthquakes are concerned, is
    an exaggerated example of the principles which are followed in the
    construction of an ordinary Japanese dwelling.</p>

  <p>Another plan adopted in South America can be gathered from the same
    author’s writings upon Lima, about which he says, ‘To build high houses
    would be to erect structures for the first earthquake to make sport of,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
    and, therefore, in order to obtain space, safety, and comfort, the
    houses of the wealthy surround court after court, filled with flowers,
    and cooled with fountains, connected one with another with wide
    passages which give a vista from garden to garden.’</p>

  <p>History would indicate that houses of this type have been arrived at as
    the results of experience, for it is said that when the inhabitants of
    South America first saw the Spaniards building tall houses, they told
    them they were building their own sepulchres.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

  <p>In Jamaica, we find that even as early as 1692 experience had taught
    the Spaniards to construct low houses, which withstood shakings better
    than the tall ones.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

  <p>In Caraccas, which has been called the city of earthquakes, it is
    said that the earthquakes cause an average yearly damage amounting to
    the equivalent of a <i xml:lang="la">per capita</i> tax of four dollars. To reduce this
    impost to a minimum much attention is paid to construction. ‘Projecting
    basement corners (giving the house a slightly pyramidal appearance)
    have been found better than absolutely perpendicular walls; mortised
    corner-stones and roof beams have saved many lives when the central
    walls have split from top to bottom; vaults and key-stone arches, no
    matter how massive, are more perilous than common wooden lintels, and
    there are not many isolated buildings in the city. In many streets
    broad iron girders, riveted to the wall, about a foot above the house
    door, run from house to house along the front of an entire square.
    Turret-like brick chimneys, with iron top ornaments, would expose the
    architect to the vengeance of an excited mob; the roofs are flat,
    or flat terraced; the chimney flues terminate near the eaves in a
    perforated lid.’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p><em>Typical houses for earthquake countries.</em>—From what has now been said
    about the different buildings found in earthquake countries, it will be
    seen that if we wish to put up a building able to withstand a severe
    shaking, we have before us structures of two types. One of these types
    may be compared with a steel box, which, even were it rolled down a
    high mountain, would suffer but little damage; and the other, with a
    wicker basket, which would equally withstand so severe a test. Both
    of these types may be, to some extent, protected by placing them upon
    a loose foundation, so that but little momentum enters them at their
    base. One suggestion is to place a building upon iron balls. Another
    method would be to place them upon two sets of rollers, one set resting
    upon the other set at right angles. The Japanese, we have seen, place
    their houses on round stones. The solid type of building is expensive,
    and can only be approached partially, whilst the latter is cheap, and
    can be approached closely. In the case of a solid building it would be
    a more difficult matter to support it upon a movable foundation than in
    the case of a light framework. Such a building is usually firmly fixed
    on the ground, and consequently at the time of an earthquake, as has
    already been shown by experiment, must be subjected to stresses which
    are very great. In consequence also of the greater weight of the solid
    structure, more momentum will enter it at its base than in the case of
    the light structure. Also, we must remember that the rigidity favours
    the transmission of momentum, and with rigid walls we are likely to
    have ornaments, coping-stones, and the comparatively freer portions
    forming the upper part of a building displaced; whilst, with flexible
    walls absorbing momentum in the friction of their various parts, such
    disturbances would not be so likely. Mr. T. Ronaldson, referring to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
    this, says, that in 1868, at San Francisco, the ornamental stone work
    in stone and cement buildings was thrown from its position, whilst
    similar ornaments in neighbouring brick buildings stood.</p>

  <p>To reduce the top weight of a building, hollow bricks might be
    employed. To render a building more homogeneous and elastic, the
    thickness of bricks might be reduced. Inasmuch as the elasticity
    of brick and timber are so different, the two ought to be employed
    separately. For internal decorations plaster mouldings might be
    replaced by <i xml:lang="fr">papier mâché</i> and <i xml:lang="fr">carton-pierre</i>, the elastic yielding of
    which is comparatively great.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Houses, whether of brick and stone,
    or of timber, ought to be broad and low, and the streets three or four
    times as wide as the houses. The flatter the roofs the better.</p>

  <p>One of the safest houses for an earthquake country would probably be a
    one-storied strongly framed timber house, with a light flattish roof
    made of shingles or sheet-iron, the whole resting on a quantity of
    small cast-iron balls carried on flat plates bedded in the foundations.
    The chimneys might be made of sheet-iron carried through holes free of
    the roof. The ornamentation ought to be of light materials.</p>

  <p>At the time of severe earthquakes many persons seek refuge from their
    houses by leaving them. In this case accidents frequently happen from
    the falling of bricks and tiles. Others rush to the doorways and
    stand beneath the lintels. Persons with whom the author has conversed
    have suggested that strongly constructed tables and bedsteads in
    their rooms would give protection. To see persons darting beneath
    tables and bedsteads would undoubtedly give rise to humiliating and
    ludicrous exhibitions. This latter idea is not without a value, and
    most <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
    certainly, if applied in houses of the type described, would be
    valuable.</p>

  <p>The great danger of fire may partially be obviated by: the use of
    ‘earthquake lamps,’ which are so constructed that before they overturn
    they are extinguished. It is said that in South America some of the
    inhabitants are ready at any moment to seek refuge in the streets,
    and they have coats prepared, stocked with provisions and; other
    necessaries, which, if occasion demands, will enable them to spend the
    night in the open air. These coats, called ‘earthquake coats,’ might
    also, with properly constructed houses, be rendered unnecessary.</p>

  <p><em>Destruction due to the nature of the underlying rocks.</em>—That the
    nature of the ground on which a building stands is intimately related
    with the severity of the blow it receives is a fact which has often
    been demonstrated.</p>

  <p>One cause of destruction is due to placing a building on foundations
    which are capable of receiving the full effects of a shock, and
    transmitting it to the buildings standing on them.</p>

  <p>For instance, the reason why a soft bed might possibly make a good
    foundation, is, as has been pointed out by Messrs. Perry and Ayrton,
    because the time of transmission of momentum is increased; in fact, the
    soft bed is very like a piece of wood interposed between a nail and
    the blows of a hammer—it lengthens the duration of impact. For this
    reason we are told that a quaking bog will make a good foundation. When
    a shock enters loose materials its waves will be more crowded, and it
    is possible that a line of buildings may rest on more than one wave
    during a shock. There are many examples on record of the stability of
    buildings which rested on beds of particular material at the time of
    destructive earthquakes. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    the observations which have been made
    by various writers on this subject appear to point in a contrary
    direction, I give the following examples:—</p>

  <p>In the great Jamaica earthquake of 1692, the portions of Port
    Royal which remained standing were situated on a compact limestone
    foundation; whilst those on sand and gravel were destroyed (‘Geological
    Observer,’ p. 426). Again, on p. 148 of the same work, we read,
    ‘According to the observations made at Lisbon, in 1737, by Mr. Sharpe,
    the destroying effects of this earthquake were confined to the tertiary
    strata, and were most violent on the blue clay, on which the lower part
    of the city is constructed. Not a building on the secondary limestone
    or on the basalt was injured.’</p>

  <p>In the great earthquakes of Messina, those portions of the town
    situated on alluvium, near the sea, were destroyed, whilst the high
    parts of the town, on granite, did not suffer so much. Similar
    observations were made in Calabria, when districts consisting of
    gravel, sand, and clay became, by the shaking, almost unrecognisable,
    whilst the surrounding hills of slate and granite were but little
    altered. At San Francisco, in 1868, the chief destruction was in the
    alluvium and made ground.</p>

  <p>At Talcahuano, in 1835, the only houses which escaped were the
    buildings standing on rocky ground; all those resting on sandy soil
    were destroyed.</p>

  <p>From the results of observations like these, it would seem the harder
    rocks form better foundations than the softer ones. The explanation of
    this, in many cases, appears to lie in the fact that the soft strata
    were in a state of unstable equilibrium, and by shaking, they were
    caused to settle. Observations like the following, however, point out
    another reason why soft strata may sometimes afford a bad foundation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

  <p>‘Humboldt observed that the Cordilleras, composed of gneiss and
    mica-slate, and the country immediately at their foot, were more shaken
    than the plains.’<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>‘Some writers have asserted that the wave-like movements (of the
    Calabrian earthquake in 1783) which were propagated through recent
    strata from west to east, became very violent when they reached the
    point of junction with the granite, as if a reaction was produced when
    the undulatory movement of the soft strata was suddenly arrested by the
    more solid rocks.’</p>

  <p>Dolomieu when speaking of this earthquake says, the usual effect ‘was
    to disconnect from the sides of the Apennines all those masses (of sand
    and clay) which either had not sufficient bases for their bulk, or
    which were supported only by lateral adherence.’</p>

  <p>These intensified actions taking place at and near to lines of
    junction between dissimilar strata is probably due to the phenomena of
    reflection and refraction.</p>

  <p>When referring to the question as to whether buildings situated on
    loose materials suffered more or less than those on solid rocks,
    Mallet, in his description of the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857,
    remarks: ‘We have in this earthquake, towns such as Saponara and
    Viggiano, situated upon solid limestone, totally prostrated; and we
    have others such as Montemarro, to a great extent based upon loose
    clays, totally levelled. We have examples of almost complete immunity
    in places on plains of deep clay as that of Viscolione, and in places
    on solid limestone, like Castelluccio, or perched on mountain tops like
    Petina.’<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

  <p>After reading the above, we see that the probable reason why, in
    several cases, beds of soft materials have not made
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>good foundations,
    consists in the fact that they have either been of small extent or else
    have been observed only in the neighbourhood of lines which divided
    them from other formations, which lines are always those of great
    disturbances.</p>

  <p>At the end of his description of the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857,
    Mallet says that more buildings were destroyed on the rock than on the
    loose clay. This, however, he remarks, is hardly a fact from which we
    can draw any valuable deductions, because it so happened that more
    buildings were constructed on the hills than on the loose ground.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

  <p>Professor D. S. Martin, writing on the earthquake of New England in
    1874, remarks that in Long Island the shock was felt where there was
    gneiss between the drift. Around portions to the east the observations
    were few and far between. He also remarks that generally the shocks
    were felt more strongly and frequently on rocky than on soft ground.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

  <p>From these examples, it would appear that the hard ground, which
    usually means the hills, forms a better foundation than the softer
    ground, which is usually to be found in the valleys and plains. Other
    examples, however, point to a different conclusion. For instance, a
    civil engineer, writing about the New Zealand earthquake of 1855, when
    all the brick buildings in Wellington were overthrown, says that ‘it
    was most violent on the sides of the hills at those places, and least
    so in the centre of the alluvial plains.’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

  <p>In this example it must be noticed that the soft alluvium here referred
    to was of large extent, and not loose material resting on the flanks of
    rocks, from which it was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
    likely to be shaken down, as in most of the previous examples.</p>

  <p>The results of my own observations on this subject point as much in one
    direction as in the other. In Tokio, from instrumental observations
    upon the slopes and tops of hills, the disturbance appears to be
    very much less than it is in the plains. Thus, at my house, situated
    on the slope of a hill about 100 feet in height, for the earthquake
    of March 11, 1882, I obtained a maximum amplitude of motion of from
    three to four millimètres only, whilst Professor Ewing, with a similar
    instrument, situated on the level ground at about a mile distant,
    found a motion of fully seven millimètres. This calculation has been
    confirmed by observations on other earthquakes. Thus, for instance, in
    the destructive earthquake of 1855, when a large portion of Tokio was
    devastated, it was a fact, remarked by many, that the disturbance was
    most severe on the low ground and in the valleys, whilst on the hills
    the shock had been comparatively weak. As another illustration, I may
    mention that within three-quarters of a mile from my house in Tokio
    there is a prince’s residence which has so great a reputation for the
    severity of the shakings it receives that its marketable value has been
    considerably depreciated, and it is now untenanted.</p>

  <p>In Hakodadi, which is a town situated very similarly to Gibraltar,
    partly built on the slope of a high rocky mountain and partly on a
    level plain, from which the mountain rises, the rule is similar to
    that for Tokio, namely, that the low, flat ground is shaken more
    severely than the high ground. At Yokohama, sixteen miles south-west
    from Tokio, the rule is reversed, as was very clearly demonstrated
    by the earthquake of February 1880, when almost every house upon the
    high ground lost its chimney, whilst on the low ground there was
    scarcely any damage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
    done; the only places on the low ground which
    suffered were those near to the base of the hills. The evidence as to
    the relative value of hard ground as compared with soft ground, for
    the foundation of a building, is very conflicting. Sometimes the hard
    ground has proved the better foundation and sometimes the softer, and
    the superiority of one over the other depends, no doubt, upon a variety
    of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>These latter observations open up the inquiry as to the extent to which
    the intensity of an earthquake may be modified by the topography of the
    disturbed area.</p>

  <p><em>The swing of mountains.</em>—If an earthquake wave is passing through
    ground the surface of which is level, so long as this ground is
    homogeneous, as the wave travels further and further we should expect
    its energy to become less and less, until, finally, it would insensibly
    die out. If, however, we have standing upon this plain a mountain,
    judging from Mallet’s remarks, this mountain would be set in a state
    of vibration much in the same way as a house is set in vibration,
    and it would tend to oscillate backward and forward with a period of
    vibration dependent upon the nature of its materials, size, and form.
    The upper portion of this mountain would, in consequence, swing through
    a greater arc than the lower portion, and buildings situated on the top
    of it would swing to and fro through a greater arc than those which
    were situated near its foot. This explanation why buildings situated
    on the top of a mountain should suffer more than those situated on
    a plain, is one which was offered by Mallet when writing of the
    Neapolitan earthquake. He tells us that towns on hills are ‘rocked as
    on the top of masts,’ and if we accept this explanation it would, in
    fact, be one reason why the houses situated on the Bluff at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> Yokohama
    suffered more than those situated in the settlement. This explanation
    is given on account of the great authority it claims as a consequence
    of its source. It is not clear how the statement can be supported,
    as different portions of the mountain receive momentum in opposite
    directions at the same time.</p>

  <p><em>Want of support on the faces of hills.</em>—When a wave of elastic
    compression is propagated through a medium, we see that the energy of
    motion is being continually transmitted from particle to particle of
    that medium. A particle, in moving forwards, meets with an elastic
    resistance of the particles towards which it moves, but, overcoming
    these resistances, it causes these latter particles to move, and in
    turn to transmit the energy to others further on. So long as the medium
    in which this transfer of energy is continuous, each particle has a
    limit to its extent of motion, dependent on the nature of the medium.
    When, however, the medium, which we will suppose to be the earth, is
    not continuous, but suddenly terminates with a cliff or scarp, the
    particles adjacent to this cliff or scarp, having no resistance offered
    to their forward motion, are shot forward, and, consequently, the
    ground here is subjected to more extensive vibrations than at those
    places where it was continuous. This may be illustrated by a row of
    marbles lying in a horizontal groove; a single marble rolled against
    one end of this row will give a concussion which will run through the
    chain, like the bumping of an engine against a row of railway cars, and
    as a result, the marble at the opposite end of the row, being without
    support, will fly off. Tyndall illustrates the same thing with his
    well known row of boys, each one standing with his arms stretched out
    and his hands resting upon the shoulders of the boy before him. A push
    being given to the boy at the back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
    the effect is to transmit a push
    to the first boy, who, being unsupported, flies forward.</p>

  <p>In the case of some earthquakes, most disastrous results have occurred
    which seem only to admit of an explanation such as this. A remarkable
    instance of this kind occurred when the great earthquake of 1857 ‘swept
    along the Alps from Geneva to the east-north-east, and its crest
    reached the edge of the deep glen between Zermatt and Visp. Then the
    upper part of the wave-movement, a thousand or two thousand feet in
    depth from the surface, came to an end; the forward pulsation acted
    like the breaker of the sea, and heavy falls of rock encumbered the
    western side of the valley.’</p>

  <p><em>Earthquake shadows.</em>—If a mountain stands upon a plain through which
    an elastic wave is passing, which is almost horizontal, the mountain
    is, so to speak, in the <em>shadow</em> of such a wave. If we only consider
    the normal motion of this wave, we see that the only motion which the
    mountain can obtain will be a wave of elastic distortion produced
    by a shearing force along the plain of the base. Should, however,
    the wave approach the mountain from below, and emerge into it at a
    certain angle, only the portion of the mountain on the side from
    which the wave advanced could remain in shadow, whilst the portion
    on the opposite side would be thrown into a state of compression and
    extension. Portions in shadow, however, would be subject to waves
    of elastic distortion. In a manner similar to this we may imagine
    that certain portions of the bluff, so far as the advancing wave was
    concerned, were in shadow, and thus saved from the immediate influence
    of the direct shock. A hypothetical case of such a shadow is shown in
    the accompanying section, illustrating the contour of the ground at
    Yokohama. The situation which might be in the shadow of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> one shock,
    however, it is quite possible might not be in that of another. We
    must also remember that a place in shadow for a direct shock might be
    affected by reflected waves, and also by the transverse vibrations of
    the direct shock. These effects are over and above the effects produced
    by the waves of elastic distortion just referred to. It might be asked
    whether whole countries, like England, which are but seldom shaken, are
    in shadow.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p138.jpg" width="700" height="247" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>—Hypothetical section at Yokohama.</div>
  </div>

  <p><em>Destruction due to the interference of waves.</em>—Referring to the
    section of the ground at Yokohama (Fig. 27), it will be seen that
    both the settlement and the bluff stand upon beds of gravel capping
    horizontal beds of grey tuff. The gravel of that portion of the
    settlement on the seaboard originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
    formed the line of a shingle
    beach. That portion of the settlement back from the sea stands upon
    ground which was originally marshy. In the central portions of the
    settlement this bed of gravel is very thick, perhaps 100 feet or so,
    but as you near the edge of the bluff it probably becomes thinner,
    until it finally dies out upon the flanks of the scarps.</p>

  <p>On the top of the bluff, the beds of gravel will, in every probability,
    be generally thinner than they are upon the lower level. The beds of
    tuff, which is a soft grey-coloured clay-like rock, produced by the
    solidification of volcanic mud, appear, when walking on the seaboard,
    to be horizontally stratified. If there is a dip inland, it is in all
    probability very slight. Here and there the beds slightly faulted.
    Taken as a whole we may consider these beds as being tolerably
    homogeneous, and an earthquake in passing through them would meet
    with but little reflection or refraction. At the junction of these
    beds with the overlying gravels, both reflection and refraction would
    comparatively be very great.</p>

  <p>On entering the gravel, as the wave would be passing into a less
    elastic medium, the direction of the wave would be bent towards the
    perpendicular to the line of junction, and the angle of emergence at
    the surface would consequently be augmented. At the surface certain
    reflection would also take place, but the chief reflections would be
    those at the junction of the tuff and the alluvium.</p>

  <p>Under the settlement it is probable that all the reflections which took
    place would be single. Thus wave fronts like <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub> advancing
    in a direction parallel to the line <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>; would be reflected in
    a direction <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> and give rise to a series of reflected waves
    <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>2</sub>. These are shown by thicker lines. Similarly all the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>neighbouring waves to the right and left of
    <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub> would give
    rise to a series of reflected waves. If the lines drawn representing
    wave fronts are districts of compression, then, where two of the
    lines cross each other, there would be double energy in producing
    compression. Similarly, districts of rarefaction might accord, and,
    again, compression of one wave might meet with the rarefaction
    of another and a neutralisation of effect take place. A diagram
    illustrating concurrence and interference of this description is given
    in Le Conte’s ‘Elements of Geology,’ p. 115. The interference which has
    been spoken of, however, is not the greatest which would occur. The
    greatest would probably be beneath the bluff and the scarps which run
    down to join the level ground below. This would be the case because it
    is a probability that there might not only be cases of interference of
    single reflected waves, but also of waves which had been not only twice
    but perhaps thrice reflected. For example, a wave like <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>1</sub>
    (which is parallel to <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub> of the first supposition),
    advancing in a direction parallel to <i>b</i><sub>1</sub> might be reflected
    along the line <i>b</i><sub>2</sub> giving rise to waves like <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>2</sub>,
    which in turn might be reflected along <i>b</i><sub>3</sub> giving rise to waves
    like <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>3</sub>. The number of districts where there would be
    concurrence and interference would, in consequence of the number of
    times waves might be reflected, be augmented. Here the violence of
    the shock would, at certain points, be considerably increased, but
    as a general result energy must be lost, so that even if some of the
    reflected waves found their way into the portion we have regarded as
    being in shadow, their intensity would not be so great as if they had
    entered it directly.</p>

  <p>The shaking down of loose materials from the sides of hills may be
    partially explained on the assumption of an increased disturbance due
    to interference.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquake bridges.</em>—In certain parts of South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> America there appear
    to exist tracts of ground which are practically exempt from earthquake
    shocks, whilst the whole country around is sometimes violently shaken.
    It would seem as if the shock passes beneath such a district as water
    passes beneath a bridge, and for this reason these districts have been
    christened ‘bridges.’</p>

  <p>This phenomenon appears to depend upon the nature of the underlying
    soil. When an elastic wave passes from one bed of rock to another of a
    different character, a certain portion of the wave is reflected, while
    the remainder of it is transmitted and refracted, and ‘bridges’ we
    may conceive of as occurring where the phenomenon of total reflection
    occurs.</p>

  <p>In the instances given of soft materials having proved good
    foundations, it was assumed that they had chiefly acted as absorbers
    of momentum. They have also acted as reflecting surfaces, and where no
    effects have been felt by those residing on them, this may have been
    the result of total reflection, and the soft beds thus have played the
    part of bridges.</p>

  <p>Fuchs gives an example taken from the records of the Syrian earthquake
    of 1837, where not only neighbouring villages suffered differently, but
    even neighbouring houses. In one case a house was entirely destroyed,
    whilst in the next house nothing was felt.</p>

  <p>In Japan, at a place called Choshi, about 55 miles east of the capital,
    earthquakes are but seldom felt, although the surrounding districts may
    be severely shaken.</p>

  <p>From descriptions of this place it would appear that there is a large
    basaltic boss rising in the midst of alluvial strata. The immunity from
    earthquakes in this district has probably given rise to the myth of
    the Kanam rock, which is a stone supposed to rest upon the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> head of a
    monstrous catfish (Namadzu), which by its writhings causes the shakings
    so often felt in this part of the world.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

  <p>Prof. D. S. Martin, writing on the earthquake of New England in 1874,
    says that it was felt at four points; it was felt in the heart of
    Brooklyn all within a circle of half a mile across; ‘and this fact
    would suggest that a ridge of rock perhaps approaches the surface at
    that point, though none is known to appear.’<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

  <p>The subject of special districts, which are more or less protected from
    severe shakings, will be again referred to, and it will be seen that
    after a seismic survey has been made even of a country like Japan,
    where there are on the average at least two earthquakes per day, it
    is possible to choose a place to build in as free from earthquakes as
    Great Britain.</p>

  <p><em>General examples of earthquake effects.</em>—The following examples of
    earthquake effects are drawn from Mallet’s account of the Neapolitan
    earthquake of 1857.</p>

  <p>At a town called Polla there was great destruction. Judging from
    the fissures in the parts that remained standing it seemed that the
    emergence of the shock had been more vertical in the upper part of the
    town than in the lower, proving that whatever had been the angle below,
    the hill had itself vibrated, which, being horizontal, had modified the
    angle of the fissures.</p>

  <p>Diano suffered but little, partly because it was well built, and partly
    on account of its situation, which was such that before the shock
    reached it the disturbance had to pass from beds of clay into nearly
    vertically placed beds of limestone. Also a great portion of the shock
    was cut off by the Vallone del Raccio to the north and north-west
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> of
    the town. Here the effects of the partial extinction of the wave on the
    ‘free outlaying stratum’ were visible in the masses of projected rock.</p>

  <p>Castellucio did not suffer because its well buttressed knoll was end
    on to the direction of shock, and on account of a barrier of vertical
    breccia beds protecting it upon the east.</p>

  <p>Pertosa stands on a mound. The destruction was least in the southern
    part of the town. From the relation of the beds of breccia on which the
    town stands, and the direction of the wave-path, it is evident that the
    southern part of the town received the force of the shock through a
    greater thickness of the breccia beds than the other parts did.</p>

  <p>Petina, standing on a level limestone spur jutting out from a mountain
    slope, suffered nothing, whilst Anletta five miles to the south-west,
    and Pertosa six miles distant, were in great part prostrated. (1) The
    terrace did not vibrate, and (2) between Petina and Anletta there is
    almost 6,000 feet of piled up limestone, so that any shock emergent at
    a steep angle had to pass up transversely through these beds.</p>

  <p><em>Protection of buildings.</em>—In addition to giving proper construction
    to our buildings, choosing proper foundations and positions for them,
    something might possibly be done to ward off the destructive effects of
    an earthquake. We read that the Temple of Diana at Ephesus was built on
    the edge of a marsh, in order to ward off the effect of earthquakes.
    Pliny tells us that the Capitol of Rome was saved by the Catacombs,
    and Elisée Reclus<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> says that the Romans and Hellenes found out that
    caverns, wells, and quarries retarded the disturbance of the earth,
    and protected edifices in their neighbourhood.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> The tower of Capua was
    saved by its numerous wells. Vivenzis asserts that in building the
    Capitol the Romans sunk wells to weaken the effects of terrestrial
    oscillations. Humboldt relates the same of the inhabitants of San
    Domingo.</p>

  <p>Quito is said to receive protection from the numerous cañons in the
    neighbourhood, whilst Lactacunga, fifteen miles distant, has often been
    destroyed.</p>

  <p>Similarly, it is extremely probable that many portions of Tokio have
    from time to time been protected more or less from the severe shocks of
    earthquakes by the numerous moats and deep canals which intersect it.</p>

  <p>Although we are not prepared to say how far artificial openings of this
    description are effectual in warding off the shocks of earthquakes,
    from theoretical considerations, and from the fact that their use has
    been discovered by persons who, in all probability, were without the
    means of making theoretical deductions, the suggestions which they
    offer are worthy of attention.</p>

  <p><em>General conclusions.</em>—The following are a few of the more important
    results which may be drawn from the preceding chapter:—</p>

  <p>1. In choosing a site for a house find out by the experience of others
    or experimental investigation the localities which are least disturbed.
    In some cases this will be upon the hills, in others in the valleys and
    on the plains.</p>

  <p>2. A wide open plain is less likely to be disturbed than a position on
    a hill.</p>

  <p>3. Avoid loose materials resting on harder strata.</p>

  <p>4. If the shakings are definite in direction, place the blank walls
    parallel to such directions, and the walls with many openings in them
    at right angles to such directions.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

  <p>5. Avoid the edges of scarps or bluffs, both above and below.</p>

  <p>6. So arrange the openings in a wall, that for horizontal stresses the
    wall shall be of equal strength for all sections at right angles.</p>

  <p>7. Place lintels over flat arches of brick or stone.</p>

  <p>8. To withstand destructive shocks either rigidly follow one or other
    of the two systems of constructing an earthquake-proof building. The
    light building on loose foundations is the cheaper and probably the
    better.</p>

  <p>9. Let all portions of a building have their natural periods of
    vibration nearly equal.</p>

  <p>10. If it is a necessity that one portion of a building should have a very
    different period of vibration to the remainder, as for instance a
    brick chimney in a wooden house, it would seem advisable either to let these
    two portions be sufficiently free to have an independent motion,
    or else they must be bound together with great strength.</p>

  <p>11. Avoid heavy topped roofs and chimneys. If the foundations were free
    the roof might be heavy.</p>

  <p>12. In brick or stone work use good cement.</p>

  <p>13. Let archways curve into their abutments.</p>

  <p>14. Let roofs have a low pitch, and the tiles, especially those upon
    the ridges, be well secured.</p>

  <p><em>Cracks and fissures formed in the ground.</em>—Almost all large
    earthquakes have produced cracks in the ground. The cracks which were
    found in the ground at Yokohama (February 22, 1880) were about two or
    three inches wide, and from twenty to forty yards in length. They could
    be best seen as lines along a road running near the upper edge of some
    cliffs which overlook the sea at that place. The reason that cracks
    should have occurred in such a position rather than in others was
    probably owing to the greater motion at such a place, due to the face
    of the cliff being unsupported, and there being no resistance opposed
    to its forward motion. It often happens that earthquake cracks are many
    feet in width. At the Calabrian earthquake of 1783, one or two of the
    crevasses which were formed were more than 100 feet in width and 200
    feet in depth. Their lengths varied from half a mile to a mile.<a
    id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
    Besides these large cracks, many smaller ones of one or two feet in
    breadth and of great length were formed. In
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>the large fissures many
    houses were engulfed. Subsequent excavations showed that by the closing
    of the fissures these had been jammed together to form one compact
    mass. These cracks are usually more or less parallel, and at the same
    time parallel to some topographical feature, like a range of mountains.
    For example, the cracks which were formed by the Mississippi earthquake
    of 1812 ran from north-east to south-west parallel to the Alleghanies.
    By succeeding shocks these crevasses are sometimes closed and sometimes
    opened still wider. Their permanency will also depend upon the nature
    of the materials in which they are made.</p>

  <p>During an earthquake large cracks may suddenly open and shut.</p>

  <p>During the convulsions of 1692 which destroyed Port Royal, it is said
    that many of the fissures which were formed, opened and shut. In some
    of these, people were entirely swallowed up and buried. In others they
    were trapped by the middle, and even by the neck, where if not killed
    instantaneously they perished slowly. Subsequently their projecting
    parts formed food for dogs.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
    class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

  <p>The earthquake which, July 18, 1880, shook the Philippines caused many
    fissures to be found, which in some places were so numerous that the
    ground was broken up into steps. Near to the village of San Antonio the
    soil was so disturbed that the surface of a field of sugar-canes was
    so altered that in some cases the top of one row of full grown plants
    was on a level with the roots of the next. Into one such fissure a boat
    disappeared, and into another, a child.</p>

  <p>Subsequently the child was excavated, and its body, which was found a
    short distance below the surface, was completely crushed.<a id="FNanchor_40"
    href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

  <p>At the time of the Riobamba earthquake, not only were men engulfed,
    but animals, like mules, also sank into the fissures which were formed.</p>

  <p>The fissures which were formed at the time of the Owen’s Valley
    earthquake in 1872 extended for miles nearly parallel to the
    neighbouring Sierras. In some places the ground between the fissures
    sank twenty or thirty feet, and at one place about three miles east of
    Independence, a portion of the road was carried eighteen feet to the
    south by a fissure.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41"
    class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

  <p>Speaking generally, it may be said that all large earthquakes are
    accompanied by the formation of fissures. The Japanese have a saying
    that at the time of a large earthquake persons must run to a bamboo
    grove.</p>

  <p>The object of this is to escape the danger of being engulfed in
    fissures, the ground beneath a bamboo grove being so netted together
    with fine roots that it is almost impossible for it to be rent open.</p>

  <p><em>Materials discharged from fissures.</em>—Together with the opening of
    cracks in the earth it often has happened that water, mud, vapours,
    gases, and other materials, have been ejected.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Mississippi earthquake water, mixed with sand and
    mud, was thrown out with such violence that it spurted above the tops
    of the highest trees. In Italy such phenomena have often been repeated.</p>

  <p>From the fissures which were formed in 1692 at the time of the
    earthquakes in Sicily, water issued which in some instances was
    salt.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

  <p>By the Cachar earthquake (January 10, 1869) numerous fissures were
    formed parallel to the banks of a river, from this water and mud were
    ejected. Dr. Oldham, who describes this earthquake, says that the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
    first shot of dry mud or sand was mistaken for smoke or steam. The
    water was foul, and hotter than surface water at the time, but only
    slightly so; and the sulphurous smell was nothing more than you would
    perceive in stirring up the mud at the bottom of any stagnant pool
    which had lain undisturbed for some time.<a id="FNanchor_43"
    href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

  <p>In 1755, when Tauris was destroyed, boiling water issued from the
    cracks which were formed. Similar phenomena were witnessed at a place
    eight miles from La Banca in Mexico, in the year 1820. Part of this hot
    water was pure and part was muddy.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the water which has been ejected has been so muddy that the
    mud has been collected to form small hills. This was the case at the
    time of the Riobamba earthquake. The mud in this case consisted partly
    of coal, fragments of augite, and shells of infusoria.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Jamaica earthquake men who had fallen into crevices
    were in some cases thrown out again by issuing water.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, as has already been mentioned, vapour, gases, and even
    flames issue from fissures. Vapour of sulphur appears to be exceedingly
    common. Kluge says that many fish were killed in consequence of the
    sulphurous vapours which rose in the sea near to the coast of New
    Zealand in 1855.</p>

  <p>On December 14, 1797, an insupportable smell of sulphur was observed to
    have accompanied the earthquake which at that time shook Cumana, which
    was greatest when the disturbance was greatest.</p>

  <p>Sulphurous fumes which were combustible were belched out of the
    earth at the time of the Jamaica earthquake in 1692. The smell which
    accompanied this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
    was so powerful that it caused a general sickness
    which swept away about 3,000 persons.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44"
    class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

  <p>From the fissures formed at Concepcion in 1835, water, which was black
    and fœtid, issued.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

  <p>The earthquakes of New England in 1727 were accompanied by the
    formation of fissures, from which sand and water boiled out in
    sufficient quantity to form a quagmire. In some places ash and sulphur
    are said to have been ejected.</p>

  <p>At one house the stink of sulphur accompanying the earthquake was so
    great that the family could not bear to remain in doors.<a id="FNanchor_46"
    href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

  <p>Emanations of gas sometimes appear to have burst out from submarine
    sources.</p>

  <p>Thus the earthquake at Lima, in March, 1865, was accompanied with great
    agitation of the water and an odour of sulphuretted and carburetted
    hydrogen. This former gas was developed to such an extent that the
    white paint of the U.S. ship ‘Lancaster’ was blackened.<a id="FNanchor_47"
    href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> With the
    smell, flames have sometimes been observed, as, for instance, at the
    time of the Lisbon earthquake.</p>

  <p>At the time of the earthquakes of 1811 and 1813, in the Mississippi
    valley, steam and smoke issued from some of the fissures which were
    formed.</p>

  <p>Instances are recorded where stones have been shot up from fissures
    unaccompanied by water, as, for instance, at the earthquake of Pasto
    (January, 1834). It is imagined that the propelling power must have
    been the sudden expansion of escaping gases.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that flames seen above fissures
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>might perhaps
    be due to the burning of materials like sulphur. Mr. D. Forbes, who
    examined the effects of the earthquakes of Mendoza, which were felt for
    a distance of 1,200 miles, says that where the hard rock came to the
    surface there were no traces of fissures, these being entirely confined
    to the alluvium. The rumours of fire and smoke having appeared at some
    of the fissures were without foundation, the presumed smoke being
    nothing but dust.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

  <p>In addition to flames lights appear often to have been observed, the
    origin of which cannot be easily explained.</p>

  <p>The earthquake of November 22, 1751, at Genoa is said to have been
    accompanied by a light like that of a prodigious fire which seemed to
    arise out of the ground.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

  <p><em>Explanation of fissure phenomena.</em>—The manner in which fissures are
    formed has already been explained when referring to the want of support
    in the face of hills (page 136).</p>

  <p>Similar remarks may be applied to the banks of rivers and all
    depressions, whether natural or artificial, which have a steep slope.
    At such places the wave of shock emerges on a free surface, which,
    being unsupported in the direction of its motion, tends to tear itself
    away from the material behind, and form a fissure parallel to the face
    of the free surface. The distance of the fissure from the face of the
    free surface will, theoretically, be equal to half the amplitude of the
    wave of motion, one half tending to move forwards, and the other half
    backwards. The reason that water and other materials rush forth from
    fissures has been explained by Schüler as being due to cracks having
    been opened through impervious <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
    strata, which, before the earthquake,
    by their continuity prevented the rising of subterranean water under
    hydrostatic pressure.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

  <p>Kluge explains the coming up of the waters as being due to the same
    causes which he considers may be the origin of disturbances in the sea.</p>

  <p>The most reasonable explanations of the eruption of water, mud, sand,
    and gas through fissures are those given by Oldham and Mallet in their
    account of the Cachar earthquake.</p>

  <p>In the case of a horizontal shock passing through a bed of ooze or
    water-bearing strata, the elastic wave will tend to pack up the water
    during the forward motion to such an extent that it will flow or
    spout up through any aperture communicating with the surface. By the
    repetition of these movements causing ejections, sand or mud cones,
    like those produced by a volcanic eruption, may be formed, and by a
    similar action water may be shot violently up out of wells, as was the
    case in Jamaica in 1692.</p>

  <p>If an emergent wave acts through a water-bearing bed upon a
    superincumbent layer of impervious material, this upper layer is,
    during the upward motion, by its inertia suddenly pressed down upon the
    latter.</p>

  <p>This pressure is equal to that which would raise the upper layer to
    a height equal to the amplitude of the motion of an earth particle,
    and with a velocity at least equal to the mean velocity of the earth
    particle resolved in the vertical direction.</p>

  <p>For a moment the water-bearing strata receive an enormous squeeze, and
    the water or mud starts up through any crevice which may be formed
    leading to the surface.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

  <p>From this we see that liquids may rise far beyond the level due to
    hydrostatic pressure.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

  <p>Volger has attributed the origin of lights or flames appearing above
    fissures to the friction which must take place between various rocky
    materials at the time when the fissures are opened. As confirmatory of
    this he refers to instances where similar phenomena have been observed
    at the time of landslips. At the time of these landslips the heat
    developed by friction has been sufficiently intense to convert water
    into steam, the tension of which threw mud and earth into the air like
    the explosion of a mine.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

  <p>The gas eruptions which occasionally take place with earthquakes are
    probably due to the opening of fissures communicating with reservoirs
    or strata charged with products of natural distillation, or chemical
    action, which previously had accumulated beneath impervious strata. Of
    the existence of such gases we have abundant evidence. In coal mines we
    have fire damp which escapes in increased quantities with a lowering of
    the barometrical pressure. In volcanic regions we have many examples of
    natural springs of carbon dioxide.</p>

  <p>These various gases sometimes escape in quantity, or erupt without
    the occurrence of earthquakes. Rossi mentions an instance where a few
    years ago quantities of fish were killed by the eruption of gas in the
    Tiber, near Rome. Another instance is one which occurred at Follonica
    on April 6, 1874. On the morning of that day many of the streets and
    roads were covered with the dead bodies of rats and mice. It seemed as
    if it had rained rats. From the facts that the bodies of the creatures
    seemed healthy, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
    that the destruction had happened suddenly, and not
    come on gradually like an epidemic, it was supposed that they had been
    destroyed by an emanation of carbon dioxide. The fact that many of them
    lay in long lines suggested the idea that they had been endeavouring
    to escape at the time of the eruption.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> If we can suppose sudden
    developments of gas like this to have occasionally accompanied
    earthquakes, we may sometimes have the means of accounting for the
    sickness which has been felt.</p>

  <p><em>Disturbances in lakes.</em>—It has often been observed that, at the time
    of large earthquakes, lakes have been thrown into violent agitation,
    and their waters have been raised or lowered. At the time of the great
    Lisbon earthquake, not only were the waters of European lakes thrown
    into a state of oscillation, but similar effects were produced in the
    great lakes of North America. In some instances, as in the case of
    small ponds, these movements may be produced by the horizontal backward
    and forward motion of the ground. At other times they are probably due
    to an actual tipping of a portion of their basins. Movements like these
    latter will be again referred to in the chapter on Earth Pulsations.
    On January 27, 1856, there was a shock of earthquake at Bailyborough,
    Ireland, which occasioned an adjacent lough to overflow its banks
    and rush into the town with great impetuosity. In returning it swept
    away two men, leaving behind a great quantity of pike and eels of a
    prodigious growth.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

  <p><em>Disturbances in rivers.</em>—Just as lakes have been disturbed, so also
    have there been sudden disturbances in rivers. Sometimes these have
    overflowed their banks, whilst at other times they have been suddenly
    dried up. In certain cases the reason that a portion of a river should
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>have become dry has been very apparent, as, for instance, at the time
    of the Zenkoji earthquake in Japan in 1847, when the Shikuma-gawa
    became partly dry in consequence of the large masses of earth which
    had been shaken down from overhanging cliffs damming a portion of
    its course, and thus forming, first, lakes, and subsequently, new
    water-courses. As another example, out of the many which might be
    quoted, may be mentioned the sudden drying up of the river Aboat,
    a tributary of the Magat, in the Philippine Islands, on July 27,
    1881, shortly after a severe shock of earthquake. The water of this
    river ceased to flow for two hours, after which it reappeared with
    considerable increase of volume and of a reddish colour. Signor E. A.
    Casariego, who describes this, remarks that the phenomenon could easily
    be explained through the slipping down of the steep banks in narrow
    parts of its upper valley, by which means its flow had been obstructed
    until the water had time to accumulate and pass over or demolish the
    obstruction.</p>

  <p>After the earthquake of Belluno (June 29, 1873), the torrent Tesa,
    which is ordinarily limpid, became very muddy.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Similar phenomena
    have been observed even in Britain, as, for instance, in 1787, when, at
    the time of a shock which was felt in Glasgow, there was a temporary
    stoppage in the waters of the Clyde. Again, in 1110, there was a
    dreadful earthquake at Shrewsbury and Nottingham, and the Trent became
    so low at Nottingham that people walked over it.</p>

  <p>The earthquake of 1158, which was felt in many parts of England, was
    accompanied by the drying up of the Thames, which was so low that it
    could be crossed on foot even at London.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

  <p>Facts analogous to these are mentioned in the accounts of many large
    earthquakes. Sometimes rivers only come muddy or change their colour.
    In an account of the Lisbon earthquake we read that some of the rivers
    near Neufchâtel suddenly became muddy.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

  <p>At other times large waves are formed. Thus the earthquake of Kansas
    (April 24, 1867) apparently created a disturbance in the rivers at
    Manhattan, which rolled in a heavy wave from the north to the south
    bank.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

  <p>Sometimes curious phenomena have happened with regard to rivers without
    the occurrence of earthquakes. Thus, for instance, on November 27,
    1838, there was a simultaneous stoppage of the Teviot, Clyde, and Nith.</p>

  <p>In these rivers similar phenomena have been observed in previous years.</p>

  <p>Again, on January 1, 1755, there was a sudden sinking of the river
    Frooyd, near Pontypool. This appears to have been due to the water
    sinking into chasms which were suddenly opened.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

  <p><em>Effects produced in springs, wells, fumaroles, &amp;c.</em>—Springs also are
    often affected by earthquakes. Sometimes the character of their waters
    change; those which were pure become muddy, whilst those which were hot
    have their temperature altered.</p>

  <p>Sometimes springs have been dried up, whilst at other times new springs
    have been formed.</p>

  <p>This latter was the case in New England (October 27, 1727). In some
    places springs were formed, whilst at other places they were either
    entirely or partly dried up.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

  <p>At and near Lisbon, in 1755, some fountains became
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>muddy, others
    decreased, others increased, and others dried up. At Montreux, Aigle,
    and other places, springs became turbid.</p>

  <p>The baths at Toplitz, in Bohemia, which were discovered in
    <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 762, were seriously affected by the same earthquake.
    Previous to the earthquake it is said that they had always given a
    constant supply of hot water. At this time, however, the chief spring
    sent up vast quantities of water and ran over. One hour before this
    it had grown turbid and flowed muddy. After this it stopped for about
    one minute, but recommenced to flow with prodigious violence, driving
    before it considerable quantities of reddish ochre. Finally, it settled
    back to its original clear state and flowed as before.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

  <p>In 1855, at the earthquake of Wallis, many new springs burst forth, and
    some of these in Nicolai Thale were so rich in iron that they quickly
    formed a deposit of ochre.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Belluno earthquake (June 29, 1873), a hot spring, La
    Vena d’Oro, suddenly became red.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

  <p>The following examples of like changes are taken from the writings of
    Fuchs.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

  <p>In 1738 the hot springs of St. Euphema rose considerably in their
    temperature.</p>

  <p>During the earthquake of October, 1848, the hot springs of Ardebil,
    which usually had a temperature of from 44° to 46° C., rose so high
    that their temperature was sufficient to cause scalding.</p>

  <p>At the time of the earthquake of Wallis, in 1855, the temperature of
    hot springs rose 7°, and the quantity of water increased three times.</p>

  <p>During the earthquake of 1835 in Chili, the springs
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>of Cauquenes fell
    from 118° to 92° F. Subsequently, however, they again rose.</p>

  <p>Fumaroles are similarly disturbed. Thus, at the time of the earthquakes
    of Martinique (September, 1875), the fumaroles there showed an abnormal
    activity.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

  <p>Wells often appear to be acted upon in the same manner as springs.</p>

  <p>At the time of the California earthquake (April, 1855), the level of
    the water in certain wells was raised ten to twelve feet.</p>

  <p>A consequence of the earthquake at Neufchâtel, in 1749, was to fill
    some of the wells with mud.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> At Constantinople, on September 2,
    1754, wells became dry.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

  <p><em>Explanation of the above phenomena.</em>—That the water in springs and
    wells should be caused to rise at the time of an earthquake, admits of
    explanation on the supposition of compressions taking place similar
    to those which cause the rise of water in fissures. That the water in
    wells and springs should be rendered turbid, is partly explained on the
    supposition of more or less dislocation taking place in the earthy or
    rocky cavities in which they are contained or through which they flow.</p>

  <p>At the time of a large earthquake it is extremely probable that there
    is a general disturbance in the lines of circulation of subterranean
    waters and gases throughout the shaken area. By these disturbances, new
    waters may be brought to the surface, two or more lines of circulation
    may be united, and the flow of a spring or supply of a well be
    augmented. Fissures, through which waters reached the surface, may be
    closed, wells may become dry, or springs may cease to flow, hot springs
    may have their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
    temperature lowered by the additions of cold water
    from another source, and, in a similar manner, waters may be altered
    in their mineralisation. An important point to be remembered in this
    consideration is the mutual dependence of various underground water
    supplies, and the area over which any given supply may circulate. A
    well in the higher part of Lincoln Heath is said to be governed by the
    river Trent, which is ten miles distant; when the river rises the well
    rises in proportion, and when the river falls the water in the well
    falls.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

  <p>The change which is usually observed in hot springs is, that before or
    with earthquakes they increase in temperature, but afterwards sink back
    to their normal state. This increase in temperature may possibly be due
    to communication being opened with new or deeper centres of volcanic
    activity, or a temporarily increased rate of flow.</p>

  <p>That the water issuing from newly formed fissures or springs should
    be hot, might be explained on the supposition of its arising from a
    considerable depth, or from some volcanic centre. It might also be
    attributed to the heat developed by friction at the opening of the
    fissures. These changes which earthquakes produce upon the underground
    circulation of waters are phenomena deserving especial attention.
    Although we know much about the circulation of surface water, it is but
    little that we yet know about the movement of the streams hidden from
    view, from which these surface waters have their sources. Earthquakes
    may be regarded as gigantic experiments on the circulatory system of
    the earth, which, if properly interpreted, may yield information of
    scientific and utilitarian value.</p>

  <p>The sudden elevations, depressions, or lateral shifting of large tracts
    of country at the time of destructive earthquakes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> are phenomena
    with which all students of geology are familiar. In most cases these
    displacements have been permanent; and evidences of many of the
    movements which occurred within the memory of man, remain as witnesses
    of the terrible convulsions with which they were accompanied.</p>

  <p><em>Movements on coast lines and level tracts.</em>—At the time of the
    great earthquake of Concepcion, on February 20, 1835, much of the
    neighbouring coast line was suddenly elevated four or five feet
    above sea level. This, however, subsequently sank until it was only
    two feet. A rocky flat, off the island of Santa Maria, was lifted
    above high-water mark, and left covered with ‘gaping and putrefying
    mussel-shells, still attached to the bed on which they had lived.’ The
    northern end of the island itself was raised ten feet and the southern
    extremity eight feet.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

  <p>By the earthquake of 1839, the island of Lemus, in the Chonos
    Archipelago, was suddenly elevated eight feet.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

  <p>Of movements like these, especially along the western shores of South
    America, Darwin, who paid so much attention to this subject, has given
    many examples. In 1822, the shore near Valparaiso was suddenly lifted
    up, and Darwin tells us that he heard it confidently asserted ‘that a
    sentinel on duty, immediately after the shock, saw a part of a fort
    which previously was not within the line of his vision, and this would
    indicate that the uplifting was not vertical.’<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> That the large areas
    of land should be shifted permanently in horizontal directions, as well
    as vertically, we should anticipate from the observations which we are
    able to make upon large fissures which are caused by earthquakes.</p>

  <p>Another remarkable example of sudden movement in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>the rocky crust is
    that which took place during the earthquakes of 1811–12 in the valley
    of the Mississippi, near to the mouth of the Ohio, which was convulsed
    to such a degree, that lakes, twenty miles in extent, were formed
    in the course of an hour. This country, which is called the ‘sunk
    country,’ extends some seventy to eighty miles north and south, and
    thirty miles east and west.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

  <p>In the ‘Gentleman’s Magazine’ we read of the little territory of
    Causa Nova, in Calabria, being sunk twenty-nine feet into the earth
    by an earthquake, without throwing down a house. The inhabitants,
    being warned by a noise, escaped into the fields, and only five were
    killed.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

  <p>Other examples of these permanent dislocations of strata are to be
    found in almost every text-book on geology.</p>

  <p><em>Geological changes produced.</em>—Passing over the accounts of earth
    movements which are more or less fictitious, and confining our
    attention to the well authenticated facts, we see at once the important
    part which earthquakes have played as agents working geological
    changes. Even in the nineteenth century long tracts of coast, as in
    Chili and New Zealand, have been raised, whilst other areas, like the
    Delta of the Indus, have been sunk. Sir H. Bartle Frere, speaking about
    the disturbance which took place in his latter region in 1819, remarks
    that all the canals drawn from the Fullalee River ceased to run for
    about three days, probably indicating a general upheaval of the lower
    part of the canal. In consequence of the earthquakes in former times
    it is not unlikely that water-courses have ceased to flow, water has
    decreased in wells, and districts have been depopulated.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

  <p>Sometimes these changes have taken place gradually and sometimes with
    violence. Mountains have been toppled over, valleys have been filled,
    cities have been submerged or buried.</p>

  <p>With the records of these convulsions before us, we see that seismic
    energy yet exhibits a terrible activity in changing the features of the
    globe.</p>

  <p><em>Reason of these movements.</em>—To formulate a single reason for these
    catastrophes would be difficult. Where they are of the nature of
    landslips, or materials have been dislodged from mountain sides, the
    cause is evidently the sudden movement of this ground acting upon
    strata not held together in a sufficiently stable condition. A similar
    explanation may be given for the sudden elevations or depressions of
    strata in a district removed from the centre where the disturbance had
    its origin. The seismic effort exhibits itself in a certain area round
    its origin as a sudden push, and by this push, strata are fractured and
    caused to move relatively to each other.</p>

  <p>At or near to the origin of an earthquake it might be argued that it
    was the sudden falling of rocky strata towards a position of stable
    equilibrium that caused the shaking, and in such a case the movements
    referred to may be regarded as the cause rather than the effect of an
    earthquake.</p>

  <p>A subject closely connected with the sudden dislocation of strata,
    is the production of secondary or consequent earthquakes, due to the
    disturbance of ground in a critical state (see p. 248).</p>

  <p><em>Sea vibrations.</em>—Whilst residing in Japan I have had many
    opportunities of conversing with persons who had experienced
    earthquakes when on board ships, and it has often happened that these
    same earthquakes have been recorded on the shore. For example, at the
    time of every moderately severe earthquake which has shaken Yokohama,
    the same disturbance has been felt on board the ships lying in the
    adjoining harbour. In some cases the effect had been as if the ship
    was grounding; in others, as if a number of sharp jerks were being
    given to the cable. The effect produced upon a man-of-war lying in the
    Yokohama harbour on the evening of March 11, 1881, was described to me
    as a ‘violent irresistible shaking.’ Vessels eighty miles at sea have
    recorded and timed shocks which were felt like sudden blows. These were
    accompanied by a noise described as a ‘dull rattle like thunder.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

  <p>In none of the cases here quoted was any disturbance of the water
    observed.</p>

  <p>The great earthquake of Lisbon was felt by vessels on the Atlantic,
    fifty miles away from shore.</p>

  <p>On February 10, 1716, the vessels in the harbour of New Pisco were so
    violently shaken that both ropes and masts were broken, and yet no
    motion in the water was observed. Some have described these shocks like
    those which would be produced by the sudden dropping of large masses of
    ballast in the hold of the vessel. Other cases are known where rigging
    was damaged, and even cannon have been jerked up and down from the
    decks on which they rested.</p>

  <p><em>Cause of vibratory blows.</em>—From the rattling sound which has
    accompanied some of these submarine shocks, many of which, it may be
    remarked, have never been recorded as earthquakes upon neighbouring
    shores, it does not seem improbable that they may have been the result
    of the sudden condensation of volumes of steam produced by submarine
    volcanic eruptions.</p>

  <p>As confirmatory of this supposition we have the fact, that many of
    the marine disturbances which might be called ‘sea-quakes,’ have been
    observed in places which are close to, or in the line of, volcanic
    vents. Thus, M. Daussy, who has paid special attention to this subject,
    has collected evidence to show that a large number of shocks have been
    felt by vessels in that portion of the Atlantic between Cape Palamas,
    on the west coast of Africa, and Cape St. Roque, on the east coast of
    South America.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

  <p>Some of the vessels only felt shocks and tremblings, but others saw
    smoke, and some even collected floating ashes. In considering the
    submarine shocks of this particular
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> area, we must bear in mind that it
    lies in the line of Iceland, the west coast of Scotland, the Azores,
    Canaries, Cape de Verd Islands, St. Helena, and other places, all of
    which, if not at present in volcanic activity, shew evidence of having
    been so within recent times. The connection between volcanic action and
    earthquakes will be again referred to.</p>

  <p><em>Sea waves.</em>—Although in the above-mentioned instances sea waves have
    not been noticed, it is by no means uncommon to find that destructive
    earthquakes have been accompanied by waves of an enormous size, which,
    if the earthquake has originated beneath the sea, have, subsequently
    to the shaking, rolled in upon the land, to create more devastation
    than the actual earthquake. It may, however, be mentioned that a few
    exceptional cases exist when it is said that the sea wave has preceded
    the earthquake, as, for example, at Smyrna, on September 8, 1852.</p>

  <p>Again, at the earthquake in St. Thomas, in 1868, it is said that the
    water receded shortly <em>before</em> the first shock. When it returned, after
    the second shock, it was sufficient to throw the U.S. ship ‘Monagahela’
    high and dry.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

  <p>Another American ship, the ‘Wateree,’ was also lost in 1868 by being
    swept a quarter of a mile inland by the sea wave which inundated
    Arequippa.</p>

  <p>Much of the great destruction which occurred at the time of the great
    Lisbon earthquake was due to a series of great sea waves, thirty to
    sixty feet higher than the highest tide, which swamped the town. These
    came in about an hour after the town had been shattered by the motion
    of the ground.</p>

  <p>The first motion in the waters was their withdrawal, which was
    sufficient to completely uncover the bar at the mouth of the Tagus. At
    Cadiz, the first wave, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
    the greatest, is said to have been sixty feet in height. Fortunately
    the devastating effect which this would have produced was partially
    warded off by cliffs.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Jamaica earthquake (1692) the sea drew back for a
    distance of a mile.</p>

  <p>In South America sea waves are common accompaniments of large
    earthquakes, and they are regarded with more fear than the actual
    earthquakes.</p>

  <p>On October 28, 1724, Lima was destroyed, and on the evening of that day
    the sea rose in a wave eighty feet over Callao. Out of twenty-three
    ships in the harbour, nineteen were sunk, and four others were carried
    far inland. The first movement which is usually observed is a drawing
    back of the waters, and this is so well known to precede the inrush of
    large waves, that many of the inhabitants in South America have used it
    as a timely warning to escape towards the hills, and save themselves
    from the terrible reaction which, on more than one occasion, has so
    quickly followed.</p>

  <p>At Caldera, near to Copiapo, on May 9, 1877, which was the time when
    Iquique was devastated, the first motion which was observed in the sea
    was that it silently drew back for over 200 feet, after which it rose
    as a wave over five feet high. At some places the water came in as
    waves from twenty to eighty feet in height.</p>

  <p>At Talcahuano, on the coast of Chili, in 1835, there was a repetition
    of the phenomena which accompanied the destruction of Penco in 1730
    and 1751. About forty minutes after the first shock, the sea suddenly
    retired. Soon afterwards, however, it returned in a wave twenty feet
    high, the reflex of which swept everything towards the sea. These
    phenomena were repeated three times.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

  <p>When Callao and Lima were destroyed, in 1746, the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>sea first drew back,
    then came in as waves, four or five minutes after the earthquake.
    Altogether, between October 28 and February 24, 451 shocks were
    counted. At one time the sea came in eighty feet above its usual
    level. One account says that the large waves came in forty-one and a
    half hours after the first shock, and seventeen and a half hours after
    comparative tranquillity had prevailed.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

  <p>At the eruption of Monte Nuovo, near Naples, in September 27, 1538, the
    water drew back forty feet, so that the whole gulf of Baja became dry.</p>

  <p>In 1696, at the time of the Catanian earthquake, the sea is said to
    have gone back 2,000 fathoms. Instances are recorded where the sea has
    receded several miles.</p>

  <p>The time taken for the flowing back of the sea is usually very
    different. Sometimes it has only been five or six minutes, whilst at
    other times over half an hour, and there are records where the time is
    said to have been still longer.</p>

  <p>Thus, at the earthquake of Santa (June 17, 1678), the sea is stated to
    have gone as far back as the eye could reach, and did not rise again
    for twenty-four hours, when it flooded everything.</p>

  <p>In 1690 at Pisco the sea went back two miles, and did not return for
    three hours. When it returns it does so with violence, and examples of
    the heights to which it may reach have been given. The greatest sea
    wave yet recorded, according to Fuchs, is one which, on October 6,
    1737, broke on the coast of Lupatka, 210 feet in height.</p>

  <p>There are, however, cases known where the sea has returned as gradually
    as it went out. Thus, on December
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>4, 1854, when Acapulco was
    destroyed, the sea is said to have returned as gently as it went out.</p>

  <p>When sea waves have travelled long distances from their origin, as,
    for instance, whenever a South American wave crosses the Pacific to
    Japan, the phenomena which are observed are like those which were
    observed at Acapulco; the sea falls and rises, at intervals of from ten
    minutes to half an hour, to heights of from six to ten feet, without
    the slightest appearance of a wave. Its phenomenon is like that of an
    unusually high tide, which repeats itself several times per hour. Even
    if we watch distant rocks with a telescope, although the surface of the
    ocean may be as smooth as the surface of a mirror, there is not the
    slightest visible evidence of what is popularly called a wave. The sea
    being once set in motion it continues to move as waves of oscillation
    for a considerable time. In 1877, as observed in Japan, the motion
    continued for nearly a whole day. The period and amplitude of the rise
    and fall were variable, usually it quickly reached a maximum, and then
    died out gradually. As observed in a self-recording tide gauge at San
    Francisco, the disturbance lasted for about four days. A diagram of
    this is here given. In its general appearance it is very similar to the
    records of other earthquake waves. The large waves represent the usual
    six hours rise and fall of the tides; usually these are fairly smooth
    curves. Superimposed on the large waves are the smaller zigzag curves
    of the earthquake disturbance, lasting with greater or less intensity
    for several days. As these curves are drawn to scale—horizontally for
    hours, and vertically one fifth inch to the foot, to show the extent of
    the rise and fall—they will be easily understood.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, as in the present example, the first movement in the
    waters is that of an incoming wave. In many
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> instances, however, this
    observation may be due to the slow and more gentle phenomena of the
    previous drawing out of the water, which in a steep waste, or when the
    water is rough, would be difficult to observe, not having been remarked.</p>

  <p>The distance to which these sea waves have extended has usually been
    exceedingly great.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—Record of Tide Gauge at Port Point,
    San Francisco.&nbsp; &nbsp; Showing Earthquake Waves of May 1877.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The sea wave of the Iquique earthquake of May 9, 1877, like many of its
    predecessors, was felt across the basin of the whole Pacific, from New
    Zealand in the south, to Japan and Kamschatka in the north. And but for
    the intervention of the Eurasian and American continents
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> would have
    made itself appreciable over the surface of the whole of our globe. At
    places on the South American coast, it has been stated that the height
    of the waves varied from twenty to eighty feet. At the Samoa Islands
    the heights varied from six to twelve feet. In New Zealand the sea rose
    and fell from three to twenty feet. In Australia the heights to which
    the water oscillated were similar to those observed in New Zealand. In
    Japan it rose and fell from five to ten feet. In this latter country,
    the phenomena of sea waves which follow a destructive earthquake on the
    South American coast are so well known that old residents have written
    to the local papers announcing the probability of such occurrences
    having taken place some twenty-five hours previously in South America.
    In this way news of great calamities has been anticipated, details of
    which only arrived some weeks subsequently. Just as the destructive
    earthquakes of South America have announced themselves in Japan, in
    a like manner the destructive earthquakes of Japan have announced
    themselves upon the tide gauges of California. Similarly, but not so
    frequently, disturbances shake the other oceans of the world.</p>

  <p>For example, the great earthquake of Lisbon propagated waves to the
    coasts of America, taking on their journey nine and a half hours.</p>

  <p><em>Sea waves without earthquakes.</em>—Sometimes we get great sea waves
    like abnormal tides occurring without any account of contemporaneous
    earthquakes. Although earthquakes have not been recorded, these ill
    understood phenomena are usually attributed to such movements.</p>

  <p>Several examples of these are given by Mallet. Thus, at 10
    <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on March 2, 1856, the sea rose and fell for a
    considerable distance at many places on the coast of Yorkshire. At
    Whitby, the tide was described ebbing and flowing six times per hour,
    and this to such a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
    that a vessel entering the harbour was alternately afloat and aground.</p>

  <p>In 1761, on July 17, a similar phenomena was observed at the same place.</p>

  <p>A like occurrence took place at Kilmore, in the county of Wexford, on
    September 16, 1864, when the water ebbed and flowed seven times in the
    course of two hours and a half. These tides, which appear to have taken
    about five minutes to rise and five minutes to fall, were seen by an
    observer approaching from the west as six distinct ridges of water. The
    general character of the phenomena appears to have been very similar to
    that which was produced at the same place by the Lisbon earthquake of
    1755; and the opinion of those who saw and wrote about their occurrence
    was that it was due to an earthquake disturbance. Such phenomena are
    not uncommon on the Wexford coast, where they are popularly known as
    ‘death waves,’ probably in consequence of the lives which have been
    lost by these sudden inundations.</p>

  <p>They have also been observed in other parts of Ireland, the north-east
    coast of England, and in many parts of the globe. They will be again
    referred to under the head of earth pulsations.</p>

  <p><em>Cause of sea waves.</em>—Mallet, who in his report to the British
    Association in 1858, writes upon this last-mentioned occurrence at
    considerable length, whilst admitting that many may have originated
    from earthquakes, he thinks it scarcely probable that an earthquake
    blow, sufficiently powerful to have produced waves like those observed
    at Kilmore, should not have been felt generally throughout the south of
    Ireland. He, therefore, suggests that sometimes waves like the above
    might be produced by an underwater slippage of the material forming
    the face of a submarine bank, the slope of which by degradation and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
    deposition, produced by currents, had reached an angle beyond the
    limits of repose of the material of which it was formed. Mallet does
    not insist upon the existence of these submarine landslips, but only
    suggests their existence as a means of explaining certain abnormal sea
    waves which do not appear to have been accompanied by earthquakes.</p>

  <p>In the generality of cases sea waves are accompanied by earthquakes,
    but it may often happen that the connection between the two is
    difficult to clearly establish. One simple explanation for the origin
    of waves occurring with earthquakes, is, that in consequence of the
    earthquake a large volume of water suddenly finds its way into cavities
    which have been opened, the disturbance produced by the inrush giving
    rise to waves.</p>

  <p>A second explanation is, that the land along a shore is caused by an
    earthquake to oscillate upwards, the water running off to regain its
    level. A supposition like this is negatived by the fact that these
    disturbances are felt far away from the chief disturbance, on small
    islands. Also, it may be added, that the whole disturbance appears to
    approach the land from the sea, and not in the opposite direction.
    Thus, in the earthquake of Oahu (February 18, 1871), it was remarked
    that the shock was first felt by the ships farthest from the land.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

  <p>Another suggestion is that the waves are due to a sudden heaving up
    of the bottom of the ocean. If this lifting took place slowly, then
    the first result would be that the water situated over the centres of
    disturbance would flow away radially in all directions from above the
    area of disturbance.</p>

  <p>If, however, the submarine upheaval took place with great rapidity, say
    by the sudden evolution of a large
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>volume of steam developed by the
    entry of water into a volcanic vent, as the water was heaped above the
    disturbed area, water might run in radially towards this spot.</p>

  <p>Supposing a primary wave to be formed in the ocean by any such causes,
    then the falling of this will cause a second wave to be formed,
    existing as a ring round the first one. The combined action of the
    first and second wave will form a third one, and so the disturbance,
    starting from a point, will radiate in broadening circles. During the
    up and down motion of these waves, the energy which is imparted to any
    particle of water will, on account of the work which it has to do in
    displacing its neighbours, by frictional resistance, gradually grow
    less and less, until it finally dies away. The waves which are the
    result of this motion will also grow less and less.</p>

  <p>If a series of sea waves were produced by a single disturbance, we see
    that these will be of unequal magnitude. Now, for small waves, the
    velocity with which they travel depends upon the square root of their
    lengths; but with large waves, like earthquake waves, the velocity
    depends upon the square root of the depth of water, and these latter
    travel more quickly than the former.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, we have a series of disturbances of unequal magnitude
    producing sea waves, which, from the series of shocks which have
    been felt upon shores subsequently invaded by waves, seems in all
    probability often to have been the case, it is not unlikely that the
    waves of an early disturbance may be overtaken and interfered with by a
    series which followed.</p>

  <p>These considerations help us to understand the appearance of the
    records on our tide gauges, and also the phenomena observed by those
    who have recorded tidal waves as they swept inwards upon the land.
    For instance, we understand the reason why sea waves, as observed at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
    places at different distances from the origin of a disturbance, should
    be of different heights. We also see an explanation for the fact that
    small waves should sometimes appear to be interpolated between large
    ones, and that these should occur at varying intervals.</p>

  <p>The fact that whenever a wave is produced, a certain quantity of water
    must be drawn from the level which surrounds it, in order that it
    should be formed, explains the phenomena that the sea is often observed
    first to draw back. Out in the open ocean it is drawn from the hollow
    between two waves. As has been pointed out by Darwin, it is like the
    drawing of the water from the shore of a river by a passing steamer.</p>

  <p>The difference in the height of waves, as observed at places lying
    close to each other, is probably due to the configuration of the coast,
    the interference of outlying islands, reefs, &amp;c.—causes which would
    produce similar effects in the height of tide.</p>

  <p>As a wave approaches shallow water it gradually increases in height,
    its front slope becomes steep, and its rear slope gentle, until finally
    it topples over and breaks. This increasing in height of waves is
    no doubt connected with the destruction of Talcahuano and Callao,
    which are situated at the head of shallow bays. Valparaiso, which is
    on the edge of deep water, has never been overwhelmed.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Another
    case tending to produce anomalies in the character of waves would be
    their reflection and mutual interference, the reflections due to the
    configuration of the ocean bed and coast lines.</p>

  <p>The complete phenomena which may accompany a violent submarine
    disturbance are as follows:—</p>

  <p>By the initial impulse of explosion or lifting of the ground, a ‘great
    sea wave’ is generated, which travels
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>shorewards with a velocity
    dependent upon its size and the depth of the ocean. At the same
    instant, a ‘sound wave’ may be produced in the air, which travels at a
    quicker rate than the ‘great sea wave.’ A third wave which is produced,
    is an ‘earth wave,’ which will reach the shore with a velocity
    dependent on the intensity of the impulse and the elasticity of the
    rocks through which it is propagated. This latter, which travels the
    fastest, may carry on its back a small ‘forced sea wave.’ On reaching
    the shore and passing inland, this ‘earth wave’ will cause a slight
    recession of the water as the ‘forced sea wave’ slips from its back.</p>

  <p>As these ‘forced sea waves’ travel they will give blows to ships
    beneath which they may pass, being transmitted from the bottom of the
    ocean to the bottom of the ships like sound waves in water. At the
    time of small earthquakes, produced, for example, by the explosion of
    small quantities of water entering volcanic fissures, or by the sudden
    condensation of steam from such a fissure entering the ocean, aqueous
    sound waves are produced, which cause the rattling and vibrating jars
    so often noticed on board ships.</p>

  <p><em>Phenomena difficult of explanation.</em>—Although we can in this way
    explain the origin and phenomena of sea waves, we must remember, as
    Kluge has pointed out, that it is not the simple backward and forward
    movement of the ground which produces sea waves, and that the majority
    of earthquakes which have occurred in volcanic coasts have been
    unaccompanied by such phenomena. Out of 15,000 earthquakes observed on
    coast lines, only 124 were accompanied by sea waves.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Out of 1,098
    earthquakes catalogued by Perrey for the west coast of South America,
    only nineteen are said to have been accompanied
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>by movements in the
    waters. According to the ‘Geographical Magazine’ (August 1877, p. 207),
    it would seem that out of seventy-one severe earthquakes which have
    occurred since the year 1500 upon the South American coast many have
    been accompanied by sea waves. Darwin also remarks, when speaking of
    South America, that almost every large earthquake has been accompanied
    by considerable agitation in the neighbouring sea.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

  <p>On April 2, 1851, when many towns in Chili were destroyed, the sea was
    not disturbed. At the time of the great earthquake of New Zealand (June
    23, 1855), although all the shocks came from the sea, yet there was no
    flood. The small shock of February 14, however, was accompanied by a
    motion in the sea.</p>

  <p>To these examples, which have been chiefly drawn from the writings of
    Fuchs, must be added the fact that the greater number of disturbances
    which are felt in the north-eastern part of Japan, although they
    emanate from beneath the sea, do not produce any visible sea waves.
    They are, however, sufficient to cause a vibratory motion on board
    ships situated near their origin.</p>

  <p>Another point referred to by Fuchs, as difficult of explanation,
    is, that the water, when it draws back, often does so with extreme
    slowness, and farther, in some instances, it has not returned to its
    original level. That the sea might be drawn back for a period of
    fifteen or thirty minutes is intelligible, when we consider the great
    length of the waves which are formed. Cases where it has retired for
    several hours or days, and when its original level is altered, appear
    only to be explicable on the assumption of more or less permanent
    changes in the levels of the ground. For example, in the earthquake
    of 1855 which shook New Zealand, the whole southern portion of the
    northern island was raised several feet.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

  <p>These sudden alterations in the levels of coast lines have already
    been referred to.</p>

  <p>Other points which are difficult to understand are the occurrence
    of disturbances in the sea at the time of feeble earthquakes, and
    with earthquakes occurring in distant places. As examples of such
    occurrences, Fuchs quotes the following: ‘On May 16, 1850, at 4.28
    <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, an earthquake took place in Pesth, and at 7.30 a
    motion was observed in the sea at Livorno. Again, at the time of the
    earthquake of December 19, 1850, which shook Heliopolis, a flood
    suddenly came in upon Cherbourg.’ May not these phenomena be the result
    of an earth pulsation, which produced an earthquake at one point, and a
    sea wave at another?</p>

  <p>Equally difficult to understand are the observations when the
    disturbance in the sea has occurred several hours after an earthquake;
    as, for instance, at Batavia, in 1852, when there was an interval of
    two hours; and to this must be added the observations where the motion
    of the sea has preceded that of the earthquake—as, for instance, in
    1852, at Smyrna. Whilst recognising the fact that it is possible to
    suggest explanations for many of these anomalies, we must also bear
    in mind that they are, generally speaking, exceptional, and, in some
    instances, may possibly be due to errors in observations.</p>

  <p><em>Velocity of propagation of sea waves, and depth of the ocean.</em>—It
    has long been known to physical science that the velocity with which
    a given wave is propagated along a trough of uniform depth, holds a
    relation to the depth of the trough.</p>

  <p>If <i>v</i> is the velocity of the wave, and <i>h</i> the depth of the trough,
    this relation may be expressed as follows:—</p>

  <div class="center">
    <i>h</i> = <span class="frac"><sup><i>v</i><sup>2</sup></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>g</i></sub></span>
    or <i>h</i> = <span class="x200b">(</span><span class="frac"><sup><i>v</i></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>k</i></sub></span><span class="x200b">)</span><sup>2</sup>
  </div>

  <p class="center">
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
    Where <i>g</i> = 32·19 and <i>k</i> = 5·671.
  </p>

  <p>It will be observed that these two formulæ (the first of which is
    known as Russell’s formula, and the second as Airy’s) are practically
    identical.</p>

  <p>The apparent difference is in the average value assigned to the
    constant.</p>

  <p>For large waves such as we have to deal with, it would be necessary,
    if we were desirous of great accuracy, to increase the value of <i>h</i>
    by some small fraction of itself. We might also make allowance for
    the different values of <i>g</i>, according to our position on the earth’s
    surface. With these formulæ at our disposal it is an easy matter, after
    having determined the velocity with which a wave was propagated, to
    determine the average depth of the area over which it was transmitted.</p>

  <p>In making certain earthquake investigations the reverse problem is
    sometimes useful—namely, determining the velocity with which a sea wave
    has advanced upon a shown line, from a knowledge of the depth of the
    water in which it has been propagated.</p>

  <p>Calculations of the average depths of the Pacific, dependent on the
    velocity with which earthquake waves have been propagated, have been
    made by many investigators.</p>

  <p>In most cases, however, in consequence of having assumed the wave to
    have originated on a coast line, when the evidence clearly showed it
    to have originated some distance out at sea, the calculations which
    have been made are open to criticism. The average depths which I
    obtained for various lines across the Pacific appear to be somewhat
    less than the average depth as given by actual soundings. We must,
    however, remember that the common error in actual soundings is that
    they are usually too great, it being difficult in deep-sea sounding
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
    to determine when the lead actually reaches the bottom. Until oceans
    have been more thoroughly surveyed with the improved forms of sounding
    apparatus, we shall not be able to verify the truth of the results
    which have been given to us by earthquake waves.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Examples of Calculations on Sea Waves.</span></h3>

  <p>1. <em>The wave of 1854.</em>—This wave originated near Japan, and it was
    recorded on tide gauges at San Francisco, San Diego, and Astoria.</p>

  <p>On December 23, at 9.15. <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, a strong shock was felt at
    Simoda in Japan, which, at 10 o’clock, was followed by a large wave
    thirty feet in height. The rising and falling of the water continued
    until noon. Half an hour after, the movement became more violent than
    before. At 2.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> this agitation decreased, and at 3
    <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> it was comparatively slow. Altogether there were five
    large waves.</p>

  <p>On December 23 and 25, unusual waves were recorded upon the
    self-registering tide gauges at San Francisco, San Diego, and Astoria.</p>

  <p>At San Francisco three sets of waves were observed. The average time of
    oscillation of one of the first set was thirty-five minutes, whilst one
    of the second and third sets was almost thirty-one minutes.</p>

  <p>At San Diego three series of waves were also shown, but with average
    times of oscillation of from four to two minutes shorter than the waves
    at San Francisco.</p>

  <p>The San Francisco waves appear to indicate a recurrence of the same
    phenomena.</p>

  <p>The record at San Diego shows what was probably the effect of a
    series of impulses, the heights increasing to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> third wave, then
    diminishing, then once more renewed, after which it died away.</p>

  <p>The result of calculations based on these data were:—</p>

  <p>The difference for the depths in the San Francisco path depends whether
    the length of the waves is reckoned at 210 or 217 miles. The length of
    the waves on the San Diego path were 186 or 192 miles.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

  <p><em>The wave of 1868.</em>—On August 11, 1868, a sea wave ruined many cities
    on the South American coast, and 25,000 lives were lost. This wave,
    like all the others, travelled the length and breadth of the Pacific.</p>

  <p>In Japan, at Hakodate, it was observed by Captain T. Blakiston, R.A.,
    who very kindly gave me the following account:</p>

  <p>On August 15, at 10.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, a series of bores or tidal waves
    commenced, and lasted until 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> In ten minutes there was
    a difference in the sea level of ten feet, the water rising above
    high water and falling below low water mark with great rapidity. The
    ordinary tide is only two and a half to three feet. The disturbance
    producing these waves originated between Iquique and Arica, in about
    lat. 18.28 S. at about 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on August 13. In Greenwich time
    this would be about 13h. 9m. 40s. August 13. The arrival of the wave
    at Hakodate in Greenwich time would be about 14h. 7m. 6s. August 14:
    that is to say, the wave took about 24h. 57m. to travel about 8,700
    miles, which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
    gives us an average rate of about 511 feet per second.
    These waves were felt all over the Pacific. At the Chatham Islands they
    rushed in with such violence that whole settlements were destroyed. At
    the Sandwich Islands the sea oscillated at intervals of ten minutes for
    three days.</p>

  <p>Comparing this wave with the one of 1877 we see that one reached
    Hakodate with a velocity of 511 feet per second, whilst the other
    travelled the same distance at 512 feet per second.</p>

  <p>An account of this earthquake wave has been given by F. von Hochstetter
    (‘Über das Erdbeben in Peru am 13. August 1868 und die dadurch
    veranlassten Fluthwellen im Pacifischen Ocean,’ Sitzungsberichte
    der Kaiserl. Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 58. Bd., 2. Abth.
    1868). From an epitome of this paper given in ‘Petermann’s Geograph.
    Mittheil.’ 1869, p. 222, I have drawn up the following table of the
    more important results obtained by F. von Hochstetter.</p>

  <p>The mean depths represent a mean of two sets of calculations, one made
    with the aid of Airy’s formula, and the other by Scott-Russell’s
    formula. The result of my own investigation about this disturbance, the
    origin of which, by several methods of calculation, is shown to have
    been beneath the ocean, near 71° 5′ west long., and 21° 22′ south lat.,
    are given on next page.</p>

  <p>Dr. Geinitz considers that his calculated depths of the ocean and those
    obtained by actual soundings are in accordance, a result which is
    diametrically opposed to that which I have obtained.</p>

  <p>This difference between my calculations and those of Dr. Geinitz,
    Hochstetter, and others, chiefly rests on the origin we have assigned
    for the sea waves. Dr. Geinitz, for instance, although he says that
    the origin of the 1877 earthquake was not on the continent but to
    the west in the ocean, bases all his calculations on the assumption
    that the <em>centrum</em> was at or near to Iquique, and the time at which
    that city was disturbed was the time at which the waves commenced to
    spread across the ocean. This time is 8.25 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> At this time,
    however, it appears that the waves must have been more than double
    the distance between the true origin and Iquique, from Iquique on
    their way towards the opposite side of the Pacific. Introducing this
    element into the various calculations which have been made respecting
    the depth of the Pacific Ocean as derived from observations on
    earthquake waves—which element, insomuch as the waves appear to have
    come in to inundate the land some time after the shock, needs to be
    introduced—we reduce the velocity of transit of the earthquake wave
    and, consequently, the resultant depths of the ocean.</p>

  <p>In Dr. Geinitz’s paper there are also some slight differences in the
    times at which the earthquake phenomena were observed at various localities. These, however, are but
    of minor importance. At the end of the paper by Dr. Geinitz two
    interesting tide gauge records are introduced, one from Sydney and the
    other from Newcastle. These appear to show a marked difference in the
    periods of the sea waves at these two places.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

  <p>By Scott-Russell’s rule, or, what is almost identically the same, by
    Airy’s general formula, we can calculate how long it would take such
    waves as we have been speaking about to travel over the different
    portions of each of these lines, and by adding these times together we
    obtain the time taken to travel across any one line. I have made these
    calculations, but as I get in every case answers which are too small, I
    think it unnecessary to give them.</p>

  <p>From San Francisco to Simoda the line is almost 3,567 miles, 3,000
    fathoms deep, 840 miles, 2,500 fathoms deep, and 120 miles 1,000
    fathoms deep. This gives an average depth of about 2,854 fathoms. Bache
    calculated the depth at 2,500 fathoms.</p>

  <p>If we are to consider that, because the sea wave at Simoda came in
    some time after the land shock had been felt, the origin of this
    earthquake, instead of being at Simoda, was some distance out at sea,
    this calculated depth would be reduced.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most practical problems which can be suggested to the
    seismologist is the determination of the district or districts in any
    given country from which earthquake disturbances originate. With a
    map of a country before us, shaded with tints of different intensity
    to indicate the relative frequency of seismic disturbance in various
    districts, we at once see the localities where we might dwell with
    the least disturbance, and those we should seek if we wish to make
    observational seismology a study. Before erecting observatories for
    the systematic investigation of earthquakes in a country, it would
    be necessary for us, in some way or other, to examine the proposed
    country to find out the most suitable district. The special problem
    of determining <em>approximately</em> the origin or origins of a set of
    earthquakes would be given to us. Having made this preliminary
    investigation, the next point is, by means of observatories so
    arranged that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
     they could always work in conjunction with each other,
    to determine the origins more accurately. By knowing the origin from
    which a set of shocks spring we know the general direction in which
    we may expect the most violent disturbances, and we can arrange our
    seismometers accordingly.</p>

  <p><em>Approximate determination of origins.</em>—In 1880 I obtained a tolerably
    fair idea of the distribution of seismic energy throughout Japan, by
    compiling the facts obtained from some hundreds of communications
    received from various parts of the country respecting the number of
    earthquakes that had been felt.</p>

  <p>The communications were replies to letters sent to various residents
    in the country and to a large number of public officers. By taking
    these records, in conjunction with the records made by instruments, it
    was ascertained that in Japan alone there were certainly 1,200 shocks
    felt during the year, that is to say, three or four shocks per day.
    The greater number of these shocks were felt along the eastern coast,
    commencing at Tokio, in the south, and going northwards to the end of
    the main island. These shocks were seldom felt on the west coast. It
    appeared as if the central range of mountains formed a barrier to their
    progress. Similarly, ranges of mountains to the south-west of Tokio
    prevented the shocks from travelling southwards. Proceeding in this way
    the conclusion was arrived at that the west coast, the southern part
    of Japan, and the islands of Shikoku and Kiushiu, had their own local
    earthquakes.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquake-hunting.</em>—These preliminary enquiries having shown that
    the northern part of Japan was a better district for seismological
    observations than the southern half, the next step was to subject the
    northern half to a closer analysis. This analysis was commenced by
    sending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
    to all the important towns, from thirty to one hundred miles
    distant from Tokio, bundles of postcards. These were entrusted to the
    local government offices with a request that each week one of these
    cards would be returned to Tokio stating the number of shocks felt.
    In this way it was quickly discovered that the majority of shakings
    emanated from the north and east, and seldom, if ever, passed a heavy
    range of mountains to the south. The barricade of postcards was then
    extended farther northwards, with the result of surrounding the origin
    of certain shocks amongst the mountains, whilst others were traced to
    the sea shore. By systematically pursuing earthquakes it was seen that
    many shocks had their origin beneath the sea—they shook all the places
    on the north-east coast, but it was seldom that they crossed through
    the mountains, forming the backbone of the island, to disturb the
    places on the west coast.</p>

  <p>The actual results obtained in three months by this method of working
    are shown in the accompanying map, which embraces the northern half of
    the main island of Nipon and part of Yezo. The shaded portion of the
    map indicates the mountainous districts, which are traversed by ranges
    varying in height from about 2,000 and 7,000 feet. The dotted lines
    show the boundaries of the more important groups of earthquakes which
    were recorded.</p>

  <p>I. is the western boundary of earthquakes, which at places to the
    eastward are usually felt somewhat severely. Some of these have been
    felt the most severely at or near Hakodadi, whilst farther south their
    effects have been weak. Occasionally the greatest effect has been near
    to Kameishi. Sometimes these earthquakes terminate along the western
    boundaries of III. or IV., not being able to pass the high range of
    mountains which separate the plain of Musashi from Kofu.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

      shaded with oblique lines.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

  <p>II. is the boundary of a shock confined to the plain which surrounds
    Kofu. These earthquakes are evidently quite local. Many of the
    disturbances have evidently originated beneath the ocean, having
    come in upon the land in the direction of the arrows <span class="smcap">a</span> or
    <span class="smcap">b</span>.</p>

  <p>III. This line indicates the boundary of a group of shocks which
    are often experienced in Tokio. These may come in the directions
    <span class="smcap">d</span>, <span class="smcap">e</span>, or
    <span class="smcap">f</span>. It is probable that some of
    them originate to the eastward of Yokohama, on or near to the opposite
    peninsula.</p>

  <p>IV. V. and VI. The earthquakes bounded by these lines probably
    originate in the directions <span class="smcap">c</span> or
    <span class="smcap">d</span>.</p>

  <p>VII. The earthquakes bounded by this line probably come from the
    direction <span class="smcap">e</span>.</p>

  <p>VIII. This line gives us the boundary of earthquakes which may come
    from the direction <span class="smcap">b</span>.</p>

  <p>The above boundaries sometimes do not extend so far to the westward as
    they are shown. At other times, groups like V. and VI. extend farther
    to the south-west. These earthquake boundaries, which so clearly show
    the effects of high mountains in preventing the extension of motion,
    have been drawn up, not from single earthquakes, but from a large
    series of earthquakes which have been plotted upon blank maps, and are
    now bound together to form an atlas. To give an idea of the material
    upon which I have been working, I may state that between March 1 and
    March 10, 1882, I received records of no less than thirty-four distinct
    shocks felt in districts between Hakodate and Tokio, and for each of
    these it is quite possible to draw a map. In addition to the boundaries
    of disturbances given in the accompanying map, other boundaries might
    be drawn for shocks which were more local in their character. The
    groups which contained the greatest number of shocks are III., IV., V.,
    VI., and VII. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
    work of this description it was found that a very
    important group of earthquakes might be studied by a line of stations
    commencing at Saporo in the north, passing through Hakodate, down the
    east coast of the main island, to Tokio or Yokohama in the south. A
    further aid to the study of this group, together with the study of
    an important local group, might be effected with the help of a few
    additional stations properly distributed on the plain of Musashi, which
    surrounds Tokio. With this example before us it will be recognised that
    the choice of sites for a connected set of seismological observatories
    will often be more or less a special problem. If earthquake stations
    were to be placed in different directions around Tokio without
    preliminary investigation, it is quite possible that some of them might
    be so situated that they would seldom if ever work in conjunction with
    the remaining observatories, and therefore be of but little value.
    And this remark must equally apply to districts in other portions
    of the globe. The method is crude, and, so far as actual earthquake
    origins are concerned, it only yields results which are approximate.
    The crudeness and the want of absoluteness in the results is, however,
    more than counterbalanced by the certainty with which we are enabled
    to express ourselves with regard to such results as are obtained. Even
    when working with the best instruments we have at our command, unless
    we are employing some elaborate system, this method of working gives a
    most valuable check upon our instrumental records, and enables us to
    interpret them with greater confidence.</p>

  <p><em>Determination of earthquake origins from the direction of motion.</em>—If
    we assume that an earthquake is propagated from a centre as a series
    of waves, in which normal vibrations are conspicuous, and obtain at
    two localities, not in the same straight line with the origin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> and
    sufficiently far separated from each other, the direction of movement
    of these normal motions, by drawing lines parallel to these directions
    through our two stations, the lines would intersect at a point above
    the required origin. If instead of two points we had three, or, better
    still, a large number, the results we should obtain ought to be
    still more certain. Unfortunately, it seems that earthquakes seldom
    originate from a given point, and, further, normal motions are not
    always (sufficiently) prominent. Sometimes, as has already been shown
    in the chapters on earthquake motion, they may be non-existent. It is
    probable, however, that difficulties of this sort are more usually
    associated with non-destructive earthquakes. Mallet regards the
    destructive effects of an earthquake as almost solely due to normal
    motions. If this be true, for destructive earthquakes, the problem is
    shorn of many of its difficulties. In cases where normal vibrations
    are not prominent, where we have only transverse vibrations, motions
    due to the interference of normal or transverse motions, or directions
    of motions due to the topographical or geological nature through which
    the disturbance has passed, the determination of the origin of an
    earthquake by observations on the direction in which the ground has
    been moving appears to be a problem which is practically without a
    solution. We will, therefore, only consider the determination of the
    origin of those earthquakes which have predominating directions in
    their movements, which directions we will consider as normal ones.
    The question which is, then, before us, is the determination of the
    direction of these normal movements. First of all we may take the
    evidence of our senses. In exceptional cases these have given results
    which closely approximate to the truth, but in the majority of cases
    such results are not to be relied upon, as the inhabitants of a town
    will, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
    same shock, give directions corresponding to all points
    of the compass. Much, no doubt, depends upon the situation of the
    observer, and much, perhaps, upon his temperament. If he is sitting
    in a room alone, and is accustomed to making observations on an
    earthquake, on feeling the earthquake, if he concentrates his attention
    on the direction in which he is being moved, his observations may be
    of value. If, however, he is not so situated, and his attention is
    not thus concentrated, his opinions, unless the motion has been very
    decided in its character, are usually of but little worth.</p>

  <p><em>Direction determined from destruction of buildings.</em>—When an observer
    first sees a town that has been partially shattered by an earthquake,
    all appears to be confusion, and it is difficult to imagine that in
    such apparent chaos we are able to discover laws. If, however, we take
    a general view of this destruction and compare together similarly
    built buildings, it is possible to discover that similar and similarly
    situated structures have suffered in a similar manner. By carefully
    analysing the destruction we are enabled to infer the direction in
    which the destroying forces have acted. It was chiefly by observing the
    cracks in buildings, and the direction in which bodies were overthrown
    or projected, that Mallet determined the origin of the Neapolitan
    earthquake. From the observations given in Chapter VII. it would appear
    that, with destructive earthquakes, walls which are transverse to the
    direction of motion are most likely to be overturned, whilst, with
    small earthquakes, these walls are the least liable to be fractured.</p>

  <p>From a critical examination of the <em>general</em> nature of the damage
    done on the buildings of a town, earthquake observers have shown that
    the direction of a shock may often be approximately determined. The
    direction in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
    which a body having a regular form like a prismatic
    gravestone or a cylindrical column is overturned sometimes gives the
    means by which we can determine the direction from which a movement
    came.</p>

  <p><em>The rotation of bodies.</em>—It has often been observed that almost all
    large earthquakes have caused objects like tombstones, obelisks,
    chimneys, &amp;c., to rotate.</p>

  <p>One of the most natural and at the same time most simple explanations
    is to suppose that during the shock there had been a twisting, or
    backward and forward screw-like motion in the ground. Amongst the
    Italians and the Mexicans earthquakes producing an effect like this are
    spoken of as ‘vorticosi.’ In the Calabrian earthquake, not only were
    bodies like obelisks twisted on their bases, but straight rows of trees
    seem to have been left in interrupted zigzags. These latter phenomena
    have been explained upon the assumption of the interference of direct
    waves and reflected waves, the consequence of which being that points
    in close proximity might be caused to move in opposite directions.
    Reflections such as these would be most likely to occur near to the
    junction of strata of different elasticity, and it may be remarked that
    it is often near such places that much twisting has been observed.</p>

  <p>Another way in which it is possible for twisting to have taken place
    would be by the interference of the normal and transverse waves which
    probably always exist in an earthquake shock, or by the meeting of
    the parts of the normal wave itself, one having travelled in a direct
    line from the origin, whilst the other, travelling through variable
    material, has had its direction changed.</p>

  <p>Mallet, however, has shown that the rotation may have been in many
    cases brought about without the supposition of any actual twisting
    motion of the earth—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>a
    simple backward and forward motion being quite
    sufficient. If one block of stone rests upon another, and the two are
    shaken backwards and forwards in a straight line, and if the vertical
    through the centre of gravity of the upper block does not coincide with
    the point where there is the greatest friction between the blocks,
    rotation must take place. If the vertical through the centre of gravity
    falls on one side of the centre of friction, the rotation would be in
    one direction, whilst, if on the other side, the rotation would be in
    the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Although the above explanation is simple, and also in many cases
    probably true, it hardly appears sufficient to account for all the
    phenomena which have been observed.</p>

  <p>Thus, for instance, if the stones in the Yokohama cemetery, at the time
    of the earthquake of 1880, had been twisted in consequence of the cause
    suggested by Mallet, we should most certainly have found that some
    stones had turned in one direction whilst others had been twisted in
    another. By a careful examination of the rotated stones, I found that
    every stone—the stones being in parallel lines—had <em>revolved in the
    same direction</em>, namely in a direction opposite to that of the hands of
    a watch.</p>

  <p>As it would seem highly improbable that the centre of greatest friction
    in all these stones of different sizes and shapes should have been at
    the same side of their centres of gravity, an effect like this could
    only be explained by the conjoint action of two successive shocks, the
    direction of one being transverse to the other.</p>

  <p>Although fully recognising the sufficiency of two transverse shocks
    to produce the effects which have been observed in Yokohama, I will
    offer what appears to me to be the true explanation of this phenomenon:
    it was first suggested by my colleague, Mr. Gray, and appears to be
    simpler than any with which I am acquainted.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

  <div class="figright">
    <img src="images/i_p197.jpg" width="180" height="228" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>If any columnar-like object, for example a prism which the basal
    section is represented by <span class="smcap">a b c d</span> (see fig. 30), receives a
    shock at right angles to <span class="smcap">b c</span>, there will be a tendency for
    the inertia of the body to cause it to overturn on the edge <span class="smcap">b c</span>.
    If the shock were at right angles to <span class="smcap">d c</span>, the tendency
    would be to overturn on the edge <span class="smcap">d c</span>. If the shock were in
    the direction of the diagonal <span class="smcap">c a</span>, the tendency would be to
    overturn on the point <span class="smcap">c</span>. Let us, however, now suppose the
    impulse to be in some direction like <span class="smcap">e g</span>, where <span class="smcap">g</span>
    is the centre of gravity of the body. For simplicity we may imagine
    the overturning effect to be an impulse given through <span class="smcap">g</span> in an
    opposite direction—that is, in the direction <span class="smcap">g e</span>. This force
    will tend to tip or make the body bear heavily on <span class="smcap">c</span>, and at
    the same time to whirl round <span class="smcap">c</span> as an axis, the direction of
    turn being in the direction of the hands of a watch. If, however, the
    direction of impulse had been <span class="smcap">e′ g</span>, then, although the turning
    would still have been round <span class="smcap">c</span>, the direction would have been
    <em>opposite</em> to that of the hands of a watch.</p>

  <p>To put these statements in another form, imagine <span class="smcap">g e′</span> to
    be resolved into two components, one of them along <span class="smcap">g c</span> and
    the other at right angles, <span class="smcap">g f</span>. Here the component of the
    direction <span class="smcap">g c</span> tends to make the body tip on <span class="smcap">c</span>, whilst
    the other component along <span class="smcap">g f</span> causes revolution. Similarly
    <span class="smcap">g e</span> may be resolved into its two components <span class="smcap">g c</span> and
    <span class="smcap">g f′</span>, the latter being the one tending to cause revolution.</p>

  <p>From this we see that if a body has a rectangular section, so long as
    it is acted upon by a shock which is parallel to its sides or to its
    diagonals, there ought not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
     be any revolution. If we divide our
    section <span class="smcap">a b c d</span> up into eight divisions by lines through these
    directions, we shall see that any shock the direction of which passes
    through any of the octants which are shaded will cause a <em>positive</em>
    revolution in the body—that is to say, a revolution corresponding in
    its direction to that of the movements of the hands of a watch; whilst
    if its direction passes through any of the remaining octants the
    revolution will be <em>negative</em>, or opposite to that of the hands of a
    watch. From the direction in which any given stone has turned, we can
    therefore give two sets of limits between one of which the shock must
    have come.</p>

  <p>Further, it will be observed that the tendency of the turning is to
    bring a stone, like the one we are discussing, broadside on to the
    shock; therefore, if a stone with a rectangular cross section has
    turned sufficiently, the direction of a shock will be parallel to one
    of its faces, but if it has not turned sufficiently it will be more
    nearly parallel to its faces in their new position than it was to its
    faces when in their original position.</p>

  <p>If a stone receives a shock nearly parallel with its diagonal, on
    account of its instability it may turn either positively or negatively
    according as the friction on its base or some irregularity of surface
    bearing most influence. Similarly, if a stone receives a shock parallel
    to one of its faces, the twisting may be either positive or negative,
    but the probability is that it would only turn slightly; whereas in the
    former case, where the shock was nearly parallel to a diagonal, the
    turning would probably be great.</p>

  <p><em>Determination of direction from instruments.</em>—When speaking about
    earthquakes it was shown, as the result of many observations, that
    the same earthquake in the space of a few seconds, although it may
    sometimes have only one direction of motion, very often has many
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
    directions of motion. In certain cases, therefore, our records, if we
    assume the most permanent motions to be normal ones, give definite and
    valuable results. In other cases it is necessary to carefully analyse
    the records, comparing those taken at one station with those taken at
    another.</p>

  <p>One remarkable fact which has been pointed out in reference to
    artificial earthquakes produced by exploding charges of gunpowder or
    dynamite, and also with regard to certain earthquakes, is that the
    greatest motion of the ground is <em>inwards</em>, towards the point from
    which the disturbance originated. Should this prove the rule, it gives
    a means of determining, not only the direction of earthquake, but the
    side from which it came.</p>

  <p><em>Determination of earthquake origins by time observations.</em>—The times
    at which an earthquake was felt at a number of stations are among the
    most important observations which can be made for the determination of
    an earthquake origin. The methods of making time observations, and the
    difficulties which have to be overcome, have already been described.
    When determining the direction from which a shock has originated, or
    determining the origin of the shock by means of time observations,
    it has been usual to assume that the velocity of propagation of the
    shock has been uniform from the origin. The errors involved in this
    assumption appear to as follows:—</p>

  <p>1. We know from observations on artificial earthquakes that the
    velocity of propagation is greater between stations near to the origin
    of the shock than it is between more remote stations; and also the
    velocity of propagation varies with the initial force which produced
    the disturbance. If our points of observation are sufficiently close
    together as compared with their distance from the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> origin of the
    disturbance, it is probable that errors of this description are small
    and will not make material differences in the general results.</p>

  <p>2. We have reasons for believing that the transit velocity of an
    earthquake is dependent on the nature of the rocks through which it
    is propagated. Errors which arise from causes of this description
    will, however, be practically eliminated if our observation points are
    situated on an area sufficiently large, so that the distribution of the
    causes tending to alter the velocity of a shock balance each other. It
    must be remarked, that causes of this description may also produce an
    alteration in the direction of our shock.</p>

  <p>Other errors which may sometimes enter into our results, when
    determining the origin of shocks by means of observations on
    velocities, are the assumptions that the disturbance has travelled
    along the surface from the <em>epicentrum</em> and not in a direct line from
    the <em>centrum</em>. Again, it is assumed that the origin is a point, whereas
    it may possibly be a cavity or a fissure. Lastly, if we desire extreme
    accuracy, we must make due allowance for the sphericity of the earth
    and the differences of elevation of the observing stations.</p>

  <p>I. <em>The method of straight lines.</em>—Given a number of pairs of points
    <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>1</sub>,
    <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>1</sub>, &amp;c., at each of which the shock was
    felt simultaneously, to determine the origin.</p>

  <p>Theoretically if we bisect the line which joins <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>
    and <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub> by a line at right angles to <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>,
    <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub>, and similarly bisect the lines <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>0</sub>,
    <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>1</sub>, all these bisecting
    lines <i>a</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>b</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>b</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, &amp;c., ought
    to intersect in a point, which point will be the <em>epicentrum</em> or the
    point above the origin.</p>

  <p>This method will fail, first, if <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub>,
    <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">b</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>0</sub>, <span class="smcap">c</span><sub>1</sub> form a
    continuous straight line, or if they form a series of parallel lines.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

  <p>Hopkins gives a method based on a principle similar to the one which
    is here employed—namely, given that a shock arrives simultaneously
    at <em>three</em> points to determine, the centre. In this case, the
    relative positions of the three points, where the time of arrival was
    simultaneous, must be accurately known, and these three points must
    not lie in a straight line, or the method will fail. For practical
    application the problem must be restricted to the case of three points
    which do not lie nearly in the same straight line.</p>

  <p>II. <em>The method of circles.</em>—Given the times <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>,
    &amp;c., at which a shock arrived at a number of places <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>,
    <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., to determine the position from
    which the shock originated.</p>

  <p>Suppose <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub> to be the place which the shock reached first,
    and that it reached <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>2</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>3</sub>,
    &amp;c., successively afterwards.</p>

  <p>
    Let&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>t</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>a</i><br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> - <i>t</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>b</i><br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>t</i><sub>3</sub> - <i>t</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>c</i>, &amp;c.
  </p>

  <p>With <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>2</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. as centres,
    describe circles with radii proportional to the known qualities <i>a</i>,
    <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c., and also a circle which passes through <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>
    and touches these circles. The centre of the last circle will be the
    <em>epicentrum</em>. The radii proportional to <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c. may be
    represented by the quantities <i>ax</i>, <i>bx</i>, <i>cx</i>, &amp;c., where <i>x</i> is the
    velocity of propagation of the shock.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that the times at which the shock arrived at three
    places might alone be sufficient. If, instead of taking the times of
    arrival of a shock, the arrival of a sea wave be taken, the result
    would be a closer approximate to the absolute truth.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that this method is not a direct one, but is one
    of trial. If, however, an imaginary case
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> be taken, and three given
    points of observation, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>,
    <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>2</sub>,
    be plotted on a piece of paper, it will be found that it is not a
    difficult matter to determine two numbers proportional to <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
    which will allow you to draw two circles so that they may be touched
    by a third circle drawn through <span class="smcap">a</span><sub>0</sub>. This problem has
    practically been applied in the case of the arrival of a sea wave
    at a number of places on the South American coast, at the time of
    the earthquake of May 9, 1877. This is illustrated as follows. The
    places which were chosen were Huanillos, Tocopilla, Cobija, Iquique,
    Mejillones.</p>

  <p>In the following table the first column gives the times at which the
    sea wave arrived at each of these places in Iquique time; in the second
    column the difference between these times and the time at which it
    reached Huanillos is given; in the third column the distances through
    which a sea wave, propagated at the rate of 350 feet per second, could
    travel during the intervals noted in the second column is given.</p>

  <p>The distances marked in the third column are used as radii of the
    circles drawn round the places to which they respectively refer.</p>

    column, and at the same time to pass through Huanillos, is marked
    <span class="smcap">c</span>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

  <p>The position from which the shock originated appears therefore to have
    occurred very near to a place lying in Long. 7° 15′ W. and Lat. 21° 22′ S.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The actual operations which were gone through in making the
    accompanying map were as follows. First, the places with which we had
    to deal were represented on a map in orthographical projection, the
    centre of projection<span id="Page_204" class="pagenum">204</span>
    being near to the centre of the map. This was
    done so that the measurements which were made upon the map might be
    more correct than those we should obtain from an ordinary chart where
    this portion of the world was not the centre of projection. Next, a
    number was taken as equal to the velocity with which the sea wave had
    travelled. The first velocity taken was about 400 feet per second—this
    being about the velocity with which, theoretically, it must have
    travelled in an ocean having a depth equal to that indicated upon the
    charts—also it seemed to have travelled at this rate from the various
    times of arrival as recorded at places along the coast. Circles were
    then drawn round Tocopilla, Cobija, Iquique, and Mejillones with radii
    equal to 2, 8, 10, and 15, each multiplied by (60 × 400). It was then
    seen <em>by trial</em> that it was impossible to draw a single circle which
    should touch four circles and also pass through Huanillos. These four
    circles were, in fact, too large. Four new but smaller circles, which
    are shown in the map, were next drawn, their radii being respectively
    equal to the numbers 2, 8, 10, and 16, each multiplied by (60 × 350),
    and it was found that a circle, with a centre <span class="smcap">c</span>, could be
    drawn which would practically touch the four circles, and at the same
    time would pass through Huanillos.</p>

  <p>III. <em>The method of hyperbolas.</em>—The method which I call that of
    hyperbolas is only another form of the method of circles. It is,
    however, useful in special cases, as, for instance, where we have the
    times of arrival of earthquakes at only two stations. Between Tokio
    and Yokohama, at which places I frequently obtain tolerably accurate
    time records, the method has been applied on several occasions with
    advantage. In the preceding example let us suppose that the only time
    records which we had were for Huanillos and Mejillones, and that the
    wave was felt at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
     latter place sixteen minutes or 960 seconds after
    it was experienced at the former. Calling these places <span class="smcap">h</span> and
    <span class="smcap">m</span> respectively, round <span class="smcap">m</span> draw a circle equal to the
    960 multiplied by the velocity with which the wave was propagated. It
    is then evident that the origin of this disturbance must be the centre
    of a circle which passes through <span class="smcap">h</span> and touches the circle
    drawn round <span class="smcap">m</span>. Join <span class="smcap">h m</span>, cutting the circle round
    <span class="smcap">m</span> in <span class="smcap">y</span>. Bisect <span class="smcap">y h</span> in <span class="smcap">v</span>. It is
    evident that <span class="smcap">v</span> is one possible origin for the disturbance.
    Next, from <span class="smcap">m</span>, in the direction of <span class="smcap">h</span>, draw any line
    <span class="smcap">m z p</span>; join <span class="smcap">z h</span>; bisect <span class="smcap">z h</span> at right angles
    by the line <span class="smcap">o p n</span>. Because <span class="smcap">ph</span> = <span class="smcap">pz</span>, it is
    evident that <span class="smcap">p</span> is a second possible origin. Proceeding in this
    way a series of points lying to the right and left of <span class="smcap">v</span> on
    the curve <span class="smcap">r v t</span> may be found, and we may therefore say that
    the origin lies somewhere in the curve <span class="smcap">r v t</span>. By increasing
    or decreasing our velocity we vary the position of the curve <span class="smcap">r v t</span>,
    and, instead of a line on which our origin may be, we obtain a
    band. As the assumed velocity increases, the circle round <span class="smcap">m</span>
    becomes larger, and has its limit when it passes through <span class="smcap">h</span>,
    where the two arms of the curve <span class="smcap">r v t</span> will close together
    and form a prolongation of the line <span class="smcap">m y h</span> as the assumed
    velocity diminishes. The circle round <span class="smcap">m</span> becomes smaller
    until it coincides with the point <span class="smcap">m</span>. At such a moment the
    curve <span class="smcap">r v t</span> opens out to form a straight line bisecting
    <span class="smcap">m h</span> at right angles. The curve <span class="smcap">r v t</span> is a hyperbola
    with a vertex <span class="smcap">v</span> and foci <span class="smcap">h</span> and <span class="smcap">m</span>. Inasmuch
    as <span class="smcap">pm</span> - <span class="smcap">ph</span> = a constant quantity. If we have the
    time given at which the shock or wave arrived at a third station as
    at Iquique, it is evident that a second hyperbola <span class="smcap">r′ v′ t′</span>
    might be drawn with Iquique and Huanillos as foci, and that the mutual
    intersection of these two hyperbolas with a third hyperbola, having for
    its foci Iquique and Mejillones, would give the origin of the wave.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
    The obtaining of a mutual intersection would depend on the assumed
    velocity, and the accuracy of the result, like that of the method
    of circles, would depend upon the trials we made. The method here
    enunciated may be carried farther by describing hyperboloids instead
    of hyperbolas, the mutual intersection of which surfaces would, in the
    case of an earth wave, give the actual origin or <em>centrum</em> rather than
    the point above the origin or <em>epicentrum</em>.</p>

  <p>IV. <em>The method of co-ordinates.</em>—Given the times at which a shock
    arrived at five or more places, the position of which we have marked
    upon a map, or chart, to determine the position on the map of the
    centre of the shock, its depth, and the velocity of propagation.</p>

  <p>Commencing with the place which was last reached by the shock, call
    these places <i>p</i>, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>p</i><sub>4</sub>, and let the
    times taken to reach these places from the origin be respectively <i>t</i>,
    <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>.</p>

  <p>Through <i>p</i> draw rectangular co-ordinates, and with a scale measure the
    co-ordinates of <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>p</i><sub>4</sub>, and let these
    respectively be <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>b</i><sub>1</sub>; <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>b</i><sub>2</sub>; <i>a</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>b</i><sub>3</sub>;
    <i>a</i><sub>4</sub>, <i>b</i><sub>4</sub>. Then if <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> be the co-ordinates of the
    origin of the shock, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>d</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>d</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>d</i><sub>4</sub>, the
    respective distances of <i>p</i>, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>p</i><sub>4</sub>
    from this origin, and <i>v</i> the velocity of the shock, we have</p>

  <p><i>x</i> and <i>y</i> determine the origin of the shock. The absolute velocity
    <i>v</i> equals √ <i>u</i>. From <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> we obtain <i>t</i>. Substituting
    <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>t</i> in the first equation we obtain <i>z</i>.</p>

  <p>We have here assumed that the points of observation have all about the

  <p>If the propagation of the wave is considered as a horizontal one, as
    would be done when calculating the position of the <em>epicentrum</em> or
    point above the origin, by means of the times of arrival of a sea wave,

  <p>From this data we find the co-ordinates <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> of this origin to
    be 85·8 and 56·7; whilst the velocity of propagation = 45 feet per
    second.</p>

  <p>Measuring these ordinates upon the map, we obtain a centre lying very
    near Long. 71° 5′ W. and Lat. 21° 22′ S., a position which is very near
    to that which has already been obtained by other methods.</p>

  <p>If instead of Huanillos we substitute the ordinates and time of arrival
    of the sea wave for Pabalon de Pica, another point for the origin will
    be obtained lying farther out at sea. To obtain the best result, the
    method to be taken will evidently be, first to reject those places
    at which it seems likely that some mistake has been made with the
    time observations, and then with the remaining places to form as many
    equations as possible, and from these to obtain a mean value. This
    is a long and tedious process, and as the time observations of this
    particular earthquake are probably one and all more or less inaccurate,
    it is hardly worth while to follow the investigation farther.</p>

  <p>In this example, as in the preceding ones, it will be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> observed that
    it has been sea waves that have been dealt with, rather than earth
    vibrations. It is evident, however, that these latter vibrations may be
    dealt with in a similar manner.</p>

  <p>In these determinations it will also have been observed that it
    is assumed that the disturbance has radiated from a centre, and,
    therefore, approached the various stations in different directions.
    If we assume that we have three stations very near to each other as
    compared with their distances from the origin, so that we can assume
    that the wave fronts at the various stations were parallel, the
    determination of the direction in which the wave advanced appears to be
    much simplified. The determination of the direction in which a wave has
    passed across three stations was first given by Professor Haughton.</p>

  <p><em>Haughton’s method.</em>—Given, the time of an earthquake shock at three
    places, to determine its horizontal velocity and coseismal line.</p>

  <p>The solution of this is contained in the formula</p>

  <div class="center">
    tan <i>ϕ</i> = <span class="frac"><sup><i>a</i> (<i>t<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>)
    sin β</sup><span>/</span><sub><i>c</i> (<i>t<sub>3</sub></i> - <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>) +
    <i>a</i> (<i>t<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>) cos β</sub></span>.
  </div>

  <p>When <span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, and <span class="smcap">c</span> are three stations at
    which a shock is observed at the times <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>, and <i>t<sub>3</sub></i>;
    <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are the distances between <span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>,
    and <span class="smcap">c</span>, and <i>ϕ</i> is the angle made by the coseismal lines <i>x</i>
    <span class="smcap">a</span> <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> <span class="smcap">b</span> <i>y</i>, and the line <span class="smcap">a b</span>, which
    are assumed to be parallel.</p>

  <p>This I applied in the case of the Iquique earthquake, but owing to
    the smallness of the angles between the three stations <span class="smcap">a</span>,
    <span class="smcap">b</span>, and <span class="smcap">c</span>, the result was unsatisfactory. The problem
    ought to be restricted, first, to places which are a long distance
    away from a centre, and, secondly, to places which are not nearly in a
    straight line. This problem may be solved more readily by geometrical
    methods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
    Plot the three stations <span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, and
    <span class="smcap">c</span> on a map, join the two stations between which there was the
    greatest difference in the time observation. Let these, for example,
    be <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">c</span>. Divide the line <span class="smcap">a c</span> at point
    <span class="smcap">d</span>, so that <span class="smcap">a d</span> : <span class="smcap">d c</span> as the interval between
    the shock felt at <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span> is to the interval between
    the shock felt at <span class="smcap">b</span> and <span class="smcap">c</span>. The line <span class="smcap">b d</span> will
    be parallel to the direction in which the wave advanced.</p>

  <p><em>The difference in time of the arrival of two disturbances.</em>—In the
    various calculations which have been made to determine an origin
    based on the assumption of a known or of a constant velocity, we have
    only dealt with a single wave, which may have been a disturbance in
    the earth or in the water. A factor which has not yet been employed
    in this investigation is the difference in time between the arrival
    of two disturbances; one propagated, for instance, through the
    earth, and the other, for example, through the ocean. The difference
    in the times of the arrival of two waves of this description is a
    quantity which is so often recorded that it is well not to pass it
    by unnoticed. To the waves mentioned we might also add sound waves,
    which so frequently accompany destructive earthquakes, and, in some
    localities, as, for instance, in Kameishi, in North Japan, are also
    commonly associated with earthquakes of but small intensity. It was by
    observing the difference in time between the shaking and the sound in
    different localities that Signor Abella was enabled to come to definite
    conclusions regarding the origin of the disturbances which affected the
    province of Neuva Viscoya in the Philippines, in 1881; the places where
    the interval of time was short, or the places where the two phenomena
    were almost simultaneous, being, in all probability, nearer to the
    origin than when the intervals were comparatively large. I myself
    applied the method with considerable success
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> when seeking for the
    origin of the Iquique earthquake of 1877. The assumptions made in that
    particular instance were, first, that the velocity of the disturbance
    through the earth was known, and, secondly, that the velocity with
    which a sea wave was propagated was also known.</p>

  <p>A method similar to the above was first suggested by Hopkins. It
    depended on the differences of velocity with which normal and
    transversal waves are propagated.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

      <span class="subhead">THE DEPTH OF AN EARTHQUAKE CENTRUM.</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <div class="summary">
    The depth of an earthquake centrum—Greatest possible depth of an
    earthquake—Form of the focal cavity.</div>

  <p><em>Depth of centrum.</em>—The first calculations of the depth at which an
    earthquake originated were those made by Mallet for the Neapolitan
    earthquake of 1857. These were made on the assumption that the earth
    wave radiated in straight lines from the origin, and, therefore, at
    points at different distances from the <em>epicentrum</em> it had different
    angles of emergence. These angles of emergence were chiefly calculated
    from the inclination of fissures produced in certain buildings, which
    were assumed to be at right angles to the direction of the normal
    motion. If we have determined the <em>epicentrum</em> of an earthquake and
    the muzoseismal circle, and make either the assumption that the angle
    of emergence in this circle has been 45° or 54° 44′ 9″ (see page
    54), it is evidently an easy matter by geometrical construction to
    determine the depth of the <em>centrum</em>. Höfer followed this method when
    investigating the earthquake of Belluno.</p>

  <p>Other methods of calculation which have been employed are based on time
    observations, as, for instance, the method of Seebach, the method of
    co-ordinates, the method of hyperboloids or spheres (see pages 200–212).</p>

  <p>By means of a number of lines parallel to twenty-six
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> angles of
    emergence, drawn in towards the seismic vertical, Mallet found that
    twenty-three of these intersected at a depth of 7⅛ geographical
    miles. The maximum depth was 8⅛ geographical miles, and the minimum
    depth 2¾ geographical miles.</p>

  <p>The mean depth was taken at a depth of 5¾ geographical miles where,
    within a range of 12,000 feet, eighteen of the wave paths intersected
    the seismic vertical.</p>

  <p>The point where these wave paths start thickest is at a depth not
    greater than three geographical miles, and this is considered to be the
    vertical depth of the focal cavity itself.</p>

  <p>For the Yokohama earthquake of 1880, from the indications of
    seismometers, and by other means, certain angles of emergence were
    obtained, leading to the conclusion that the depth of origin of that
    earthquake might be between 1½ and 5 miles.</p>

  <p>Possibly, perhaps, the earthquake may have originated from a fissure
    the vertical dimensions of which was comprised between these depths.</p>

  <p>A source of error in a calculation of this description is that the
    vertical motions may have been a component of transverse motions or
    perhaps due to the slope of surface waves.</p>

  <p>The following table of the depths at which certain earthquakes have
    originated has been compiled from the writings of several observers.</p>

  <p>A table similar to this has been compiled by Lasaulx.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

  <p>With the exception of the determination for the two last disturbances
    these calculations have been made with the assistance of the method
    of Seebach, which depends, amongst other things, on the assumptions
    of exact time determinations, direct transmission of waves from the
    centrum, and a constant velocity of propagation.</p>

  <p>Admitting that our observations of time are practically accurate, it
    appears that the other assumptions may often lead to errors of such
    magnitude that our results may be of but little value.</p>

  <p>From what has been said respecting the velocity with which earth
    disturbances are propagated, it seems that these velocities may vary
    between large limits, being greatest nearest to the origin.</p>

  <p>If we refer to Seebach’s method, we shall see that a condition of this
    kind would tend to make the differences in time between various places,
    as we recede from the <em>epicentrum</em>, greater than that required for the
    construction of the hyperbola. The curve which is obtained would, in
    consequence, have branches steeper than that of the hyperbola, and the
    resultant depth, obtained by the intersection of the asymptotes of this
    curve with the seismic vertical, indicates an origin which may be much
    too great.</p>

  <p>Another point worthy of attention, which is common to the method
    of Mallet as well as to that of Seebach, is the question whether
    the shock radiates directly from the origin, or is propagated from
    the origin more or less vertically to the surface, and then spreads
    horizontally. We know that earthquakes, both natural and artificial,
    may be propagated as undulations on the surface of the ground, and
    that the vertical motion of the latter, as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>testified by the records
    of well-constructed instruments, has no practical connection with the
    depth from which the disturbance originated.</p>

  <p>In cases like these, the direction of cracks in buildings, and other
    phenomena usually accredited to a normal radiation, may in reality be
    due to changes in inclination of the surface on which the disturbed
    objects rested. When our points of observation are at a distance from
    the <em>epicentrum</em> of the disturbance which, as compared with the depth
    of the same, is not great, calculations or observations based on the
    assumption of a direct radiation of the disturbance may possibly lead
    to results which are tolerably correct. The calculations of Mallet
    for the Neapolitan earthquake appear to have been made under such
    conditions.</p>

  <p>For smaller earthquakes, and for places at a distance from the seismic
    vertical of a destructive earthquake, the results which are deduced
    from the observations on shattered buildings, and all observations
    based upon the assumption of direct radiation, we must accept with
    caution.</p>

  <p>Another error which may enter into calculations of this description
    is one which has been discussed by Mallet at some length. This is the
    effect which the form and the position of the focal cavity may have
    upon the transmission of waves.</p>

  <p>Should the impulse originate from a point or spherical cavity, then
    we might, in a homogeneous medium perhaps, regard the isoseismals as
    concentric circles, and expect to find that equal effects had been
    produced at equal distances from the <em>epicentrum</em>. Should, however,
    this cavity be a fissure, it is evident that even in a homogeneous
    medium the inclination of the plane of such a cavity will have
    considerable effect upon the form of the waves which would radiate from
    its two walls.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

  <p>For example, let it be assumed that the first impulse of an earthquake
    is due to the sudden formation of a fissure, rent open from its centre,
    and that the waves leave the walls at all points normal to its surface.
    Then, as Mallet points out, it is evident that the disturbance will
    spread out in ellipsoidal waves, the greatest axis of which will be
    perpendicular to the plane of the fissure.</p>

  <p>By taking a number of cases of fissures lying in various directions
    and drawing the ellipsoidal waves which would result from an elastic
    pressure, like that of steam suddenly admitted into such cavities, the
    differences in effect which would be simultaneously produced by these
    waves on reaching the surface can be readily understood. The following
    example of an investigation on this subject will serve as an example to
    illustrate the general nature of the many other cases which might be
    taken.</p>

  <div class="figright">

  <p>Let a disturbance simultaneously originate from all points of the
    fissure <i>f</i> <i>f</i>. This will spread outwards in ellipsoidal shells to
    the surface of the earth <i>e</i> <i>e</i>. The major axis of these ellipsoidal
    shells will be the direction of greatest effect. In the direction <i>c</i>
    <i>d</i> the waves will plunge into the earth, and places to the right side
    of the fissure will, to use an expression due to Stokes, when speaking
    of analogous phenomena connected with sound, be in <em>earthquake shadow</em>.
    The same expression has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
    employed, somewhat differently, when
    speaking of the effects produced on buildings.</p>

  <p>For places, like <i>s</i> and <i>p</i>, situated at equal distances from the
    seismic vertical, it is evident that the intensity of the shock will be
    different, and also its time of arrival. It will also be observed that
    the isoseismals will take the form of ovals or distorted ellipses, the
    larger or fuller end of which being to the left of the fissure.</p>

  <p>Other cases, like those just given, which are discussed by Mallet in
    his account of the Neapolitan earthquake, are where the fissure forms
    the division between materials of different elasticities. In the hard
    and more elastic material the waves will be more crowded, the velocity
    of a wave particle will be greater, and the transit will be quicker
    than in the less elastic medium.</p>

  <p>The result is that the distance of equal effect from the seismic
    vertical will be greatest in the direction of the more compressible
    material.</p>

  <p>Unless these considerations are kept carefully before the mind when
    investigating the depth and, we may add, the position and form of the
    centrum of an earthquake, serious errors may arise.</p>

  <p><em>Greatest depth of an earthquake origin.</em>—A curious but instructive
    calculation which Mallet made was a determination of the greatest
    possible depth at which an earthquake may occur. This calculation is
    based upon the idea that the impulsive effect of an earthquake has an
    intimate relationship with the height of neighbouring volcanoes, the
    column of lava supported on a volcanic cone being a measure of the
    internal pressure tending to rupture the adjacent crust of the earth.</p>

  <p>Mitchell, in 1700, virtually propounded this idea, when he suggested that
    the velocity of propagation of an earthquake was related to the height
    of such a column.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

  <p>Mallet showed that there was probably considerable truth in such a
    supposition by appealing to the results of actual observation. The
    pressure gauge of the Neapolitan district would be Vesuvius, the height
    of which has in round numbers varied between 3,500 to 4,000 feet. One
    of the most destructive earthquakes in this district—namely, the one of
    1857—projected bodies with an initial velocity of about fifteen feet
    per second. The Riobamba earthquake, which projected bodies with an
    initial velocity of eighty feet per second, appears to have been the
    most violent earthquake, so far as its impulsive effort is concerned,
    of which we have any record. It occurred amongst the Andes, where there
    are volcanoes from 16,000 to 21,000 feet in height.</p>

  <p>Comparing these two earthquakes together, we see that the Riobamba
    shock had a destructive power 5·33 times that of the Neapolitan shock,
    and we also see that the Riobamba volcanoes were about 5·33 times
    higher than Vesuvius. The accordance in these quantities is certainly
    interesting, and tends to substantiate the idea that volcanoes are
    barometrical-like pressure gauges of a district.</p>

  <p>Carrying the argument still further. Mallet says that if the depth of
    origin of earthquakes were the same, then the <em>area of disturbance</em>
    would, for like formations and configuration of surface, be a measure
    of the earthquake effort, and also some function of the velocity of the
    wave. From this we may generally infer ‘that earthquakes, like that of
    Lisbon, which have a <em>very great area</em> of sensible disturbance, have
    also a very deep seismal focus, and also the greatest depth of seismal
    focus within our planet is probably not greater than that ascertained
    for this Neapolitan earthquake, multiplied by the ratio that the
    velocity of the Riobamba wave bears to that of its wave,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> or, what is
    the same thing, by the ratio of the altitudes of the volcanoes of the
    Andes to that of Vesuvius.’</p>

  <p>Now, as the depth of the Neapolitan shock may be taken at 34,930
    feet, the greatest probable depth of origin of any earthquake impulse
    occurring in our planet is limited to 5·333 × 4,930 feet, or 30·64
    geographical miles.</p>

  <p>Ingenious as this argument is, we can hardly admit it without certain
    qualifications.</p>

  <p>First, we are called upon to admit the identity of the originating
    cause of the volcano and the earthquake—as to what may be the
    originating cause of earthquakes we have yet to refer, but certainly in
    the case of particular earthquakes, as, for instance, those which occur
    in countries like Scotland, Scandinavia, and portions of Siberia, the
    direct connection between these phenomena are not at first sight very
    apparent.</p>

  <p>Secondly, even if we admit the identity of the origin of these
    phenomena, it is not difficult to imagine that the fluid pressure
    brought to bear upon certain portions of the crust of the earth may
    possibly in many instances be infinitely greater than that indicated
    by the height of the column of liquid lava in the throat of a volcano,
    the true height of which we are unable to obtain. Further, in certain
    instances such a column only appears to be a measure of the pressure
    upon the crust of the earth in the immediate vicinity of the cone.</p>

  <p>Thus, in the Sandwich Islands, we have lava standing in the throat
    of the volcano of Mauna Loa 10,000 feet higher than it stands in the
    crater Kilauea, only twenty miles distant. That these columns should be
    measures of the same pressure, originating in a general subterranean
    liquid layer with which they are connected, is a supposition difficult
    to satisfactorily substantiate.</p>

  <p>Another measure of the impulsive efforts which subterranean
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>terranean forces
    may exert upon the crust above them is evidently the height to which
    volcanoes eject materials. Cotopaxi is said to have hurled a 200-ton
    block of stone nine miles. Sir W. Hamilton tells us that in 1779
    Vesuvius shot up a column of ashes 10,000 feet in height; and Judd
    tells us that this same mountain in 1872 threw up vapours and rock
    fragments to the enormous height of 20,000 feet. This would indicate an
    initial velocity of 1,131 feet per second.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding Mallet’s calculation that thirty miles is the limiting
    depth for the origin of an earthquake, the origin of the Owen’s
    Valley earthquake of March 1872 was estimated as being at least fifty
    miles.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

  <p><em>Form of the focal cavity.</em>—Among the various problems which are put
    before those who study the physics of the interior of our earth it
    would at first sight appear that there was none more difficult than the
    attempt to determine the form of the cavity, if it be a cavity, from
    which an earthquake originates. Almost all investigators of seismology
    have recognised that the birthplace of an earthquake is not a point,
    and have made suggestions about its general nature. The ordinary
    supposition is that the earthquake originates from a fissure, and if
    the focus of a disturbance could be laid bare to us it would have the
    appearance of a fault such as we so often see exposed on the faces of
    cliffs.</p>

  <p>A strong argument, tending to demonstrate that some of the shakings
    which are felt in Japan are due to the production of such fissures,
    is the fact that the vibrations which are recorded are transverse to
    a line joining the point of observation and the district from which,
    by time observations, we know the shock to have originated. The most
    probable explanation of this phenomena appears to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>be that one mass
    of rock has been sliding across another mass, giving rise to shearing
    strains, and producing waves of distortion.</p>

  <p>The first seismologist who attacked the problem of finding out the
    dimensions and position of such a fissure was Mallet, when working on
    the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857. The reasons that the origin should,
    in the first place, have been a fissure, rather than any other form of
    cavity, was that such a supposition seemed to be <i xml:lang="la">a priori</i> the most
    probable, and, further, that it afforded a better explanation of the
    various phenomena which were observed, than that obtained from any
    other assumption.</p>

  <p>The method on which Mallet worked to determine the form and position of
    the assumed fissure, which method was subsequently more or less closely
    followed by other investigators, was as follows:—</p>

  <p>From an observation of the various phenomena produced upon the surface
    of the disturbed area, a map of isoseismals was constructed. These were
    seen, as has been the case with many earthquakes, not to distribute
    themselves in circles round the <em>epicentrum</em>, but as distorted oval or
    elliptical figures, the major axes of which roughly coincided with each
    other. Further, the <em>epicentrum</em>, did not lie in the centre of these
    ovals, but was near to the narrow end where they converged.</p>

  <p>This at once showed, if the reasoning respecting the manner in which
    waves are propagated from an inclined fissure be correct, that the
    fissure was at right angles to the major axis of the curves, dipping
    from their narrow end downwards, in the direction of their larger
    widespread ends.</p>

  <p>The next weapon which Mallet employed to attack this problem was the
    sound which was heard at different points round about the focus. These
    sounds appear to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
    been of the nature of sudden explosive reports
    accompanied by rushing, rolling sounds. The form of the area in which
    these sounds were heard was closely similar to that of the first two
    isoseismals. Except in the central area of great disturbance, no sound
    was heard to accompany the shock.</p>

  <p>Those at the northern and southern extremity of the sound area all
    described what they heard as a ‘low, grating, heavy, sighing rush, of
    twenty to sixty seconds’ duration.’ Those in the middle and towards the
    east and west boundaries of this area described a sound of the same
    tone, but shorter and more abrupt, and accompanied with more rumbling.</p>

  <p>The nature of the arguments which were followed in discussing the sound
    observations will be found in the chapter relating to these phenomena.</p>

  <p>A portion of the argument which it is difficult to follow relates to
    the maximum rate at which it can be supposed possible for a fissure to
    be rent in rocks, which rate depends on the density and elasticity of
    these rocks and other constant factors.</p>

  <p>Next it was observed that the paths of the waves drawn on the surface,
    although generally intersecting in a point, did not do so absolutely,
    but along a line passing through the main focus some 7½ miles in
    length. This, coupled with the observations of sounds, led to the
    supposition that the centre of disturbance, considered horizontally,
    originated along a curved line passing through the chief focus and the
    various intersections of the wave paths.</p>

  <p>The last phenomena brought forward to assist in the solution of this
    interesting problem were a study of the tremulous movements that
    preceded and followed the shock, and their relation to the sound
    phenomena.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

  <p>If the earthquake originated by the formation of a fissure, after the
    rending has gone on for a certain time the focal cavity is enlarged
    to a certain extent, and the great shock takes place. This would be
    followed by concluding tremulous waves. A succession of phenomena like
    those accompanied the shock about which Mallet writes.</p>

  <p>By observations such as these, coupled with what has been said about
    the maximum and mean depths of the focal cavity, Mallet came to the
    conclusion that the focal cavity was a fissure, the rending open of
    which produced the earthquake. The vertical dimensions of this cavity
    were not more than 5·3 miles, but were probably limited to three miles.</p>

  <p>From the intersection of the wave paths upon the surface and the
    observed emergences, this fissure followed horizontally a curve of
    double flexure, about nine geographical miles in length. The area of
    this fissure was twenty-seven geographical miles. The time of rending
    it open in Apennine limestone would be about 7½ seconds, which
    should be the same as the period during which tremors were felt. The
    time actually recorded was six or eight seconds.</p>

  <p>Briefly, this is, then, the line of reasoning which was followed by
    Mallet in an investigation the results of which are as interesting
    as they are startling. Since the line of investigation has been
    opened, and the existence of new problems has been indicated, other
    investigators, although not exactly following Mallet’s method in
    all their details, have, when endeavouring to attain the same ends,
    employed similar weapons.</p>

  <p>Thus, for example, Seebach, when determining the depth and nature of
    the origin of the earthquake of Middle Germany, reasoned somewhat as
    follows:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

  <p>Had the origin been more or less of a spherical cavity, then the region
    of most violent disturbance upon the surface would, according to a
    theorem we have already mentioned, have been upon or near a circle of
    about 8·8 miles in radius round the <em>epicentrum</em>. This region, however,
    was found by observation to lie along a curved band about forty miles
    in length, altogether on one side of the <em>epicentrum</em>.</p>

  <p>To explain this anomaly Seebach followed Mallet, and assumed that the
    origin was not a spherical cavity, but a fissure.</p>

  <p>The depth and strike of this fissure was determined by the observation
    that the area of greatest disturbance was along a curved line lying
    radial to the <em>epicentrum</em>. Such a condition it was assumed indicated
    that the fissure of origin must be inclined towards this area of
    greatest disturbance. A line was then drawn from this area to the
    <em>centrum</em>. A second line at right angles to this one gave the dip of
    the fissure.</p>

  <p>Höfer, when working on the earthquake of Belluno, came to the
    conclusion that the disturbance originated from two faults meeting
    each other at an angle of 60°. In this determination he was chiefly
    influenced by the form of a certain homoseist which was of the form of
    an elongated ellipse met on one side by a second ellipse, the principal
    axes of the two ellipses giving the strike of the two faults.</p>

  <p><em>General distribution of earthquakes.</em>—The records of earthquakes
    collected by various seismologists lead us to the conclusion that
    at some time or other every country and every ocean in the world
    has experienced seismic disturbances. In some countries earthquakes
    are felt daily, and from what will be said in the chapter on earth
    pulsations it is not unlikely that every large earthquake might with
    proper instrumental appliances be recorded at any point on the land
    surfaces of our globe. The area over which any given earthquake extends
    is indeterminate. The area over which an earthquake is sensible is
    sometimes very great. The Lisbon shock of 1755 is estimated as having
    been sensible over an area of 3,300 miles long and 2,700 miles wide,
    but in the form of tremors and pulsations it may have shaken the whole
    globe.</p>

  <p>The regions in which earthquakes are frequent are indicated in the
    accompanying map, which, to a great extent, is a reproduction of a map
    drawn by Mallet. The regions coloured with the darkest tint are those
    where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
    great earthquakes are the most frequent. The actual number of
    earthquakes which have been felt in the differently coloured areas are
    given, when speaking of the relation of seismic energy to season.</p>

  <p>When looking at this chart it must be remembered that if we were
    to make a detailed map of any one of the different countries where
    earthquakes are frequent, we should find in it all the differences that
    we observe in the general chart. For instance, one portion of Japan,
    where perhaps sixty shocks are felt per year, would be coloured with
    a dark tint, whilst other portions of the same country, where there
    is only one slight shaking felt every few years, would be left almost
    uncoloured. The black dots indicating the position of volcanic vents
    are even more general in their signification than the tinted areas.
    Professor Haughton gives for the world a list of 407 volcanoes, 225 of
    which are active. These numbers are the same as those given by A. von
    Humboldt. Of the active volcanoes 172 are on the margin of the Pacific,
    and of the total number eight are in Japan. From my own observations
    in Japan independently of the Kurile Islands, I have enumerated
    fifty-three volcanoes which are either active or have been active
    within a recent period. In a few years’ time this list will probably be
    increased. I mention this fact to show how very imperfect our knowledge
    is respecting the number of volcanic vents existing on our globe. If we
    were in a position to indicate the volcanoes which had been in eruption
    during the last 4,000 years, the probability is that they would number
    several thousands rather than four or five hundred.</p>

  <p>An inspection of the map shows that earthquakes chiefly occur in
    volcanic and mountainous regions. The most earthquake-shaken regions of
    the world form the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
    boundaries of the Pacific ocean. It may be remarked
    that these boundaries slope beneath the neighbouring ocean at a much
    steeper angle than the boundaries of countries where earthquakes occur
    but seldom. The coasts of South America, Kamschatka, the Kuriles,
    Japan, and the Sandwich Islands, for example, have slopes beneath the
    Pacific from one in twenty to one in thirty. The coasts of Australia,
    Scandinavia, and the eastern parts of South America, where earthquakes
    are practically unknown, have slopes from one in fifty to one in two
    hundred and fifty. Many earthquakes have taken place in mid-ocean. In
    the Atlantic Ocean M. Perrey has given about 140 instances of such
    occurrences.</p>

  <p>The majority of the earthquakes which shake Japan appear to have their
    origin in the neighbouring ocean. If we could draw a map of earthquake
    origins, it is probable that the greater number of the marks indicating
    these origins would be found to be suboceanic and along lines parallel
    to the shores of continents and islands which rise steeply from the
    bed of deep oceans. In countries like Switzerland and India, our marks
    would hold a relationship to the mountains of these countries.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
    Looking at the broad features of the globe, we see on its surface
    many vast depressions. Some of these saucer-like hollows form land
    surfaces, as in central Asia. The majority of these, however, are
    occupied by the oceans. Active volcanoes chiefly occur near the rim of
    the hollows which have the steepest slopes. The majority of earthquakes
    probably have their origin on or near the bottom of these slopes. To
    these, however, there are exceptions, as for instance the earthquakes
    in the Alps, in the hills of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
    Scotland, and the shakings which are
    occasionally felt in countries like Egypt. The earthquakes which shake
    the borders of the Pacific have their origins in, and their effects are
    almost exclusively felt on, the sides of the bounding ridge facing this
    ocean. In Japan it is the eastern sides of the islands which suffer,
    the western side being almost as free from these convulsions as England.</p>

  <p>Similar remarks may be made about the eastern side of South America,
    especially the southern portion of the continent. At Buenos Ayres, for
    example, there has been no disturbance since Mendoza was destroyed,
    some twenty years ago. In British Guiana slight shocks are occasionally
    felt in the low delta which forms the settled portion of the colony,
    but they are extremely rare.</p>

  <p><em>Disturbances in lines or zones.</em>—It has often been observed that
    disturbances are propagated along the length of mountains or valleys,
    and it is but seldom that earthquakes cross them transversely. Thus the
    valleys of the Rhone, the Rhine, and the Danube are lines along which
    disturbances travel.</p>

  <p>The major axes of the elliptical areas of disturbances which have
    shaken India have a general direction parallel to the valley of the
    Ganges along the flanks of the Himalayas.</p>

  <p>The disturbances which have shaken London appear to have been chiefly
    east and west, or along the valley of the Thames. In South America the
    line of disturbance is along the western sides of the Andes. Another
    line is along the northern coast of the continent through Andalusia
    and Caraccas towards the Antilles and Trinidad. The shocks of the
    Pyrenees are chiefly felt along the southern side of these mountains.
    In the middle and on the northern side they are but seldom felt. This
    propagation in lines or zones may in certain cases be apparent rather
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
    than real. Thus the north and south ranges of mountains in Japan are
    mountains almost simultaneously shaken along their eastern flanks,
    giving the impression that an earthquake had originated simultaneously
    from a fissure parallel to this line, or else, starting at one end,
    had run down their lengths. Time observations have, however, shown
    that such disturbances had their origin at some distance in the ocean,
    and, travelling inwards, had reached all points on the flanks of these
    mountains almost simultaneously. The same explanation will probably
    hold for the so-called linear disturbances of western South America.</p>

  <p>All earthquake disturbances have probably a tendency to radiate from
    their source, and are only prevented from doing so by meeting with
    heavy mountainous districts, which by their mass and structure absorb
    the energy communicated to them. Much energy is also lost by emergence
    on the open flanks of a range of mountains. Rather than say that
    high mountains often bound the extension of an earthquake, or that
    earthquakes appear to run along the flanks of such mountains, we might
    say that earthquakes have boundaries parallel to the strike of the
    rocks in a given district, that such a direction is the one in which
    the propagation is the easier.</p>

  <p>Rossi is of opinion that volcanic fractures play an important part in
    governing the distribution of seismic disturbances. When a volcano is
    formed, a series of starlike fractures are formed round the central
    crater. Secondary craters may indicate the line of these fissures. The
    mountains about Rome are regarded as typical of this radial structure.
    The more distant the secondary craters are from the centre of the
    system, the smaller will they be, and also the younger. If two fissures
    intersect we get a larger crater at the junction. Earthquakes are
    propagated along the direction of these fissures, whilst the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> rising
    and falling of these lips throw off transverse waves. Rossi adduces
    observations which appear to meet with explanation on such suppositions.</p>

  <p>Suess, who has written upon the earthquakes of lower Austria, shows how
    the majority of the disturbances have had their origin along certain
    lines which form a break in the continuity of the Alps. One line runs
    north-east from Bruck towards Vienna. Near Wiener Neustadt, where the
    greatest number and heaviest shocks have occurred, this line is met by
    a north-north-west line crossing the Danube and following the valley
    of the river Kamp.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Hoeffer has drawn similar lines from the head
    of the Adriatic, one set running north-north-east to intersect near
    Litschau, and the other north-north-west to intersect near Frankfort in
    the valley of the Rhine.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

  <p><em>Examples of distribution.</em>—A curious example of the distribution of
    seismic movement is that of the earthquake of March 12, 1873, worked
    out by Professor P. A. Serpieri. This earthquake appears to have been
    simultaneously felt on the Dalmatian coast and in central Italy, in a
    region lying north-east from Rome and south-east from Florence. In both
    of these areas the motion was from south-east to north-west. The shock
    then radiated from the central Italian regions, so that at places on
    the western shore of the Adriatic it was felt after it had been felt on
    the Dalmatian coast.</p>

  <p>Many explanations might be offered for this peculiar distribution
    of seismic activity. Possibly the shock originated at a great depth
    beneath the bed of the southern part of the Adriatic, and by following
    existing lines of weakness simultaneously reached the surface of the
    earth in central Italy and Dalmatia.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

  <p>In Tokio, which is built partly on a flat plain, partly in valleys
    denuded from a low tableland, and partly on the spurs of the tableland
    itself, the distribution of earthquakes is a subject yet requiring
    attention. Sometimes it has happened that persons in one house have
    been sufficiently alarmed to escape into the open air, whilst others,
    not more than a mile distant, have not been aware that the city had
    been shaken.</p>

  <p><em>Extension of earthquake boundaries.</em>—Natural obstructions which may be
    sufficient to retard small earthquakes may in certain instances not be
    found sufficient to retard the larger disturbances. Thus the shocks of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
    Calabria are usually only felt on the western side of the Apennines,
    but instances have occurred when they have crossed this barrier. In
    1801 the earthquake of Cumana crossed a branch of the coast range.</p>

  <p>Sometimes earthquake boundaries give way, and countries which they
    sheltered subsequently become exposed to all disturbances. The true
    explanation of this is probably in a shifting of the centre of seismic
    activity. Thus up to December 14, 1797, although Cumana was often
    devastated, the peninsula of Araya was not hurt. On this date Araya
    commenced to suffer, and has continued to suffer ever since.</p>

  <p>Fuchs gives an example of the movement of a seismic centre in the case
    of the Calabrian earthquake. The first shock commenced near Oppiedo,
    the second shock commenced four or five miles farther to the north, and
    the third shock had its origin five or six miles still farther, near to
    Girifalco.</p>

  <p><em>Seismic energy in relation to geological time.</em>—If we admit that
    seismic energy is only a form of volcanic energy, it must also be
    admitted that any cause tending to produce a general decrease in the
    amount of the latter will also produce an alteration in the amount of
    the former.</p>

  <p>The nebular hypothesis of Laplace tells us that the solar system is the
    result of the whirling of a heated gaseous mass, which as it cooled
    continually contracted and consequently whirls the faster. With this
    hypothesis before us, we understand why all the planets and their
    satellites have a similarity in the directions of their movements, why
    they revolve nearly in the same plane, in orbits nearly circular, why
    some have a flattened figure and are surrounded by rings or belts, why
    the exterior planets should have a greater velocity of rotation, a
    greater number of satellites, and a less density as compared with the
    interior planets, the similarity of the elements in meteoric stones,
    the sun, the stars, and those found upon our earth, and lastly why
    there should be an increase in temperature as we descend into our
    earth.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This increase in temperature as we descend into the earth
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
    as deduced from many observations appears to be about 1° F. for every
    fifty or sixty feet of descent.</p>

  <p>To explain this and other kindred phenomena it is assumed that the
    earth was once very much hotter than it is at present, and to reach its
    present stage it has been gradually cooling. As the laws of cooling are
    perfectly known, to calculate how many years it must have taken a body
    like our earth to cool down to its present temperature is a definite
    problem. Sir William Thomson, starting with the temperature of 7,000°
    F., when all the rocks of the earth must have been molten and a skin or
    crust upon the surface, such as is so quickly produced upon the surface
    of molten lava, finds by calculation that the time taken to reach the
    present temperature must have been about one hundred million years.
    Into this period he and other physicists desire to compress the history
    of all the stratified deposits. Geologists find this period too short.
    Others seeking to reconcile the views of physicists and geologists
    endeavour to show that the various agencies engaged in degrading rocks
    and accumulating sediments in former ages are not to be judged of by
    the agencies we now see around us; in former times they were more
    active. At one period the elastic tides in the earth may have been so
    great that they resulted in the fracturing off from our planet its
    satellite the moon, and subsequently the moon, acting on the waters of
    the earth, may, even as late as 150,000 years ago, have produced every
    three hours tides 150 feet in height.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the value of the figures here quoted, reasonings like
    these bring us to the conclusions that the various agencies which we
    now know to be acting upon our earth were once far more potent than
    they are at present, and if the moon, as a producer of elastic tides,
    has any influence upon the occurrence of earthquakes,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> it must have had
    a much greater influence in bygone times.</p>

  <p>We might speak similarly with regard to the internal heat of the earth.</p>

  <p>From the present heat gradient of our globe it is possible to calculate
    how much heat flows from the earth every year.</p>

  <p>This is equivalent to a quantity which would raise a layer of water ·67
    centimetres thick, covering the whole of our globe, from a temperature
    of 0° to 100° C.</p>

  <p>Similarly, we might calculate the quantity of heat which would be lost
    when the average heat gradient, instead of being 1° F. for fifty feet
    of descent, was 1° F. for twenty-five feet of descent.</p>

  <p>We might also calculate how many years ago it was since such a gradient
    existed.</p>

  <p>The general result which we should arrive at would be that in past
    ages the loss of heat was more rapid than it is at present. Now the
    contraction of a body as it cools is for low temperatures proportional
    to its loss of heat, and this law is also probably true for contraction
    as it takes place from high temperatures.</p>

  <p>Contraction being more rapid, it is probable that phenomena like
    elevations and depressions would be more rapid than they are at
    present, and generally all changes due to plutonic action, as has
    already been pointed out by Sir William Thomson, must have been more
    active.</p>

  <p>We have, therefore, every reason to imagine that earthquakes which
    belong to the category of phenomena here referred to were also numerous
    and occurred on a grander scale during the earlier stages of the
    world’s history than they do at present, and seismic and volcanic
    energy, when considered in reference to long periods of time, is
    probably a decreasing energy.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

  <p>In making this statement we must not overlook the fact that in
    geological time, as testified by the records of our rocks, volcanic
    action, and with it probably seismic action, has been continually
    shifting, first appearing in one area and then in another, and even
    in the same area we have evidence to show that these have periods
    of activity and repose successively succeeding each other. Thus in
    Britain, during the Palæozoic times, we have many evidences of an
    intense volcanic activity. During the Mesozoic or Secondary period
    volcanic energy appears to have subsided, to wake up with renewed
    vigour in the Cainozoic or Tertiary period.</p>

  <p>During this latter period it is not at all improbable that Scotland
    was in past times as remarkable for its earthquakes as Japan is at the
    present day.</p>

  <p>Later on it will also be shown that earthquakes are concomitant
    phenomena, with those elevatory processes which we have reason to
    believe are slowly going on in certain portions of the earth’s crust.
    If, therefore, we are able by the examination of the rocks which
    constitute the accessible portions of our globe to determine which
    periods were characterised by elevation, we may assume that such
    periods were also periods of seismic activity.</p>

  <p>Amongst these periods we have those in which various mountain ranges
    appeared. Thus the Grampians, and the mountains of Scandinavia, were
    probably produced before the deposition of the Old Red sandstone. The
    Urals were upheaved prior to Permian times. The chief upheaval in the
    Alps took place after Eocene times. The Rigi and other sub-Alpine
    mountains were formed after the deposition of the Miocene beds. About
    this same time the Himalayas were upheaved.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

  <p>The earthquakes which from time to time shake those
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>newer mountains
    apparently indicate that the process of mountain-making is hardly ended.</p>

  <p><em>Seismic energy in relation to historical time.</em>—The distribution
    of seismic energy with regard to historical time is a subject which
    has been very carefully examined by Mallet, who collected together
    a catalogue of between six and seven thousand earthquakes, embraced
    between the periods <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1606 and <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1850. The
    earthquake of <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1606 was on the occasion of the delivery of
    the law at Mount Sinai. Between <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1604 and <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    1586 an earthquake probably occurred in Arabia, when Korah, Dathan,
    and Abiram were swallowed up. Another biblical record is that of
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1566, when the walls of Jericho were overthrown.</p>

  <p>The earliest records from China is in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 595; in Japan
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 285; in India <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 894.</p>

  <p>By using the number of earthquakes which have been recorded in each
    century as ordinates, Mallet constructed a curve, which apparently
    shows a continual increase in seismic energy, especially during recent
    times. This, Mallet remarks, contradicts all the analogies of the
    physics of the globe, and points out that the rapid increase in the
    number of earthquakes in latter years is chiefly due to the greater
    number of records which have been made, and the increase of the area
    of observation. No doubt many of the records made by the ancients have
    been lost.</p>

  <p>If we compare Mallet’s records, as he invites us to do, with the
    great outlines of human progress, we see that the two increase
    simultaneously, and we come to the conclusion that, taken as a whole,
    during the historical period the seismic activity of the world has been
    tolerably constant.</p>

  <p>These conclusions, based on the evidence at our
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> command, are not to
    be confuted. If, however, instead of considering the seismic energy of
    the whole world, we consider the seismic energy of particular areas,
    it seems reasonable to expect that in certain instances sometimes a
    decrease and sometimes an increase in this energy might be discovered,
    especially, perhaps, in areas which are highly volcanic.</p>

  <p>In France we know that volcanic activity ceased at a period closely
    bordering on historical times, and it is not unlikely that seismic
    activity may have ceased at a corresponding time.</p>

  <p>In a country like Japan, it is possible that in one district seismic
    energy may be on the increase, whilst in another upon the decrease.</p>

  <p>In a country like England, it is probable that the seismic state is
    constant, and, whatever changes may be now occurring, they are taking
    place at so slow a rate that, even if our records of the historical
    period were complete, we could hardly be expected to find these changes
    sufficiently marked to be observable.</p>

  <p>For purposes of reference, and also for examining the present question,
    the table, page 240, has been compiled. The earthquakes given are
    chiefly those which have been recorded in histories as being more or
    less destructive.</p>

  <p>In the second column of this table will be seen the number of
    earthquakes which have occurred in Japan during each century, the
    centuries being marked in the first column. In columns 3 to 18
    inclusive are given the number of earthquakes which have occurred
    during different centuries in the various countries and districts
    mentioned at the head of each column. These latter, which are taken
    from the writings of Mallet, are given for the sake of comparison with
    the Japanese earthquakes. If we commence with the seventh century in
    the column for Japan, we see that a great increase in the number of earthquakes,
    as we come towards the present time, is not so observable as it is in
    the other columns.</p>

  <p>The explanation for this probably lies in the fact that Japan has
    practised civilised arts for a longer period than many of the European
    and other countries mentioned in the table.</p>

  <p>In Japan, no doubt, the records of later years have been more perfect
    than they were in early times, but this, although so potent an effacer
    of what was probably the true state of natural phenomena in the case of
    Europe, has not quite obliterated the truth in Japan; for instead of an
    apparent increase of seismic energy since early times it shows a slight
    decrease.</p>

  <p>To draw up a table of earthquakes such as the one which has just been
    given, and then, after the inspection of it, draw conclusions as to
    whether there has been an increase or decrease in seismic energy, is,
    however, hardly a just method of reasoning. The earthquakes, taken as
    they are, for the whole of Japan, represent a collection of places some
    of which are 1,000 miles apart. When we consider that many earthquakes
    which occurred at one end of this line were never felt at the other
    end, in order to justly estimate the periodicity of seismic phenomena
    it would seem that we ought either to take some particular seismic area
    or else the whole world.</p>

  <p>The particular area which has been taken is that of Kioto in Central
    Japan, and the earthquakes which have been felt there are enumerated in
    the table.</p>

  <p>In order to show the variation in seismic activity of this district a
    curve has been plotted, fig. 35, with ordinates equal to the values
    given for the Kioto earthquakes during succeeding centuries. The upper
    points of these ascending and descending lines are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> joined by a free
    curve. The lower points are similarly joined. The points of bisection
    of ordinates drawn between these two curves are taken as points in a
    curve to show the true secular change in seismic energy.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p242.jpg" width="700" height="209" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—Curve of Seismic Intensity for Kioto.</div>
  </div>

  <p>By looking at this wavy line it will be seen that the intervals between
    maxima and minima are closer together in early times than they are
    later on.</p>

  <p>Thus, between the eighth century and the ninth century, points of
    maximum and minimum seismic efforts occurred at times a century apart,
    whilst later on, from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, they were
    at intervals of 300 years apart.</p>

  <p>By inspecting either the wavy line or the resultant curve, it will be
    seen that since the ninth century down to the present time there has
    been a decided decrease in seismic energy. From the ninth century down
    to the fifteenth century this decrease is represented by a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> regular
    curve. At this point, however, the decrease becomes slightly more
    rapid, and is represented by a second curve. If, instead of calculating
    ordinates for my curve, in which intensity has been considered, simply
    the number of earthquakes are counted, a similar result is obtained.
    From this it appears that the rate at which seismic energy decreased
    during the last 500 years was about the same as that at which it
    decreased during the 500 years previous to this period.</p>

  <p>If the lists for the Italian and Turco-Hellenic districts could be
    similarly analysed, and the earthquakes of any particular district
    picked out from the others, it is very probable that a similar decrease
    or alteration in seismic energy might be observed.</p>

  <p>Provided that we have at our disposal records of the various
    earthquakes which have occurred in any given district during a
    sufficiently long period of time, one conclusion that we may expect
    to arrive at is that we shall be able to trace some variation in
    the seismic activity of that district. For the Kioto area, it has
    been shown that there is a diminution in seismic activity, In other
    districts, however, there may possibly be an increase.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

  <p><em>Relative frequency of earthquakes.</em>—A question which is of great
    interest to those who dwell in shaken districts is as to how often
    disturbances may be expected to occur.</p>

  <p>From a general examination of this question, considering the
    earthquakes of the whole world. Mallet arrived at the following
    conclusions:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

  <p>1. While the smallest or minimum paroxysmal intervals may be a year
    or two, the average interval is from five to ten years of comparative
    repose.</p>

  <p>2. The shorter intervals are in connection with periods of fewer
    earthquakes—not always with those of least intensity, but usually so.</p>

  <p>3. The alternations of paroxysm and of repose appear to follow no
    absolute law deducible from these curves.</p>

  <p>4. Two marked periods of extreme paroxysm are observable in each
    century, one greater than the other—that of greatest number and
    intensity occurring about the middle of each century, the other towards
    the end of each.</p>

  <p>The form of the curves which Mallet has drawn seem to indicate that
    seismic energy came in sudden bursts, and then subsided, gradually
    gathering strength for another exhibition. This is continually seen
    in the shocks experienced in various seismic areas—a large shock, or
    the maximum of the activity dying out by repeated small shocks on
    succeeding days.</p>

  <p>Mr. I. Hattori, writing on the large earthquakes of Japan, remarks that
    on the average there has been one large earthquake every ten years.
    They, however, occur in groups, as shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>Dr. E. Naumann, who has also written on the earthquakes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>quakes in Japan,
    remarks that if periods of seismic activity do not occur every 490
    years, there is a repetition of the cycle after 980 years, but there
    is much variability. A period of 68 years is very marked. On the
    average, large earthquakes have occurred every 5·9 years. Fuchs
    gives some interesting examples of the repetition of earthquakes at
    definite intervals, of which the following are examples. Sometimes
    earthquakes appear to have repeated themselves after 100 years. One
    remarkable example of this is that of Lima, on June 17, 1578, which was
    repeated on the same day in the year 1678. In Copiapo it is believed
    that earthquakes occur every twenty-three years, and examples of such
    repetitions are found in the years 1773, 1796, and 1819. In Canada,
    near to Quebec, earthquakes lasting forty days are said to occur every
    twenty-five years. The plateau of Ardebil is said to be regularly
    shaken by earthquakes every two years.</p>

  <p>A. Caldcleugh, writing on the earthquake of Chili, in 1835,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> remarks
    that the Spaniards first had the idea that a great earthquake occurs
    every century. Afterwards they thought the period was every fifty
    years. As a matter of fact, however, there were large earthquakes in
    1812, at Caracas; in 1818, at Copiapo; in 1822, at Santiago; in 1827,
    at Bogota; in 1828, at Lima; in 1829, at Santiago; and in 1832, at
    Huasco.</p>

  <p>The average period of seismic disturbances in any country probably
    depends upon the subterranean volcanic activity of that country.
    When the activity is great the large earthquakes may occur at short
    intervals; but when the activity is small, as in England, shocks of
    moderate intensity may not be felt more than once or twice per century.
    A general idea of the relative frequency of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>large earthquakes in
    various parts of the world may be easily obtained by an inspection of
    the table on page 240.</p>

  <p>Between the years 1850 and 1857 Kluge found that in the world there had
    been 4,620 earthquakes, which is, upon the average, nearly two per day.
    This estimate of the frequency of earthquakes of sufficient intensity
    to be recorded without the aid of instruments is, however, much below
    the truth. In Japan alone there probably occurs, as a daily average, a
    number at least equal to that which has been just given for the whole
    world. Boussingault considered that, in the Andes, earthquakes were
    occurring every instant of time.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

  <p>To state definitely how many earthquakes are felt in the world on the
    average every day is, from the data which we have at our command, an
    impossibility. Perhaps there may be ten, perhaps there may be 100. The
    question is one which remains to be decided by statistics which have
    yet to be compiled.</p>

  <p>After a large earthquake, smaller shocks usually occur at short
    intervals. At first the succession of disturbances are separated from
    each other by perhaps only a few minutes or hours. Later on, the
    intensity of these shocks usually decreases, and the intervals between
    them become greater and greater, until, finally, after perhaps a few
    months, the seismic activity of the area assumes a quiescent state.</p>

  <p>The great earthquake which overtook Concepcion on February 20, 1835,
    was followed by a succession of shocks like those just referred to,
    there being registered, between the date of the destructive shock and
    March 4, 300 smaller disturbances.</p>

  <p>During the twenty-four hours succeeding the destruction of Lima
    (October 28, 1746), 200 shocks were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
    counted, and up to the 24th of
    February in the following year 451 shocks were felt.</p>

  <p>At St. Thomas, in 1868, 283 shocks were counted in nine and a quarter
    hours.</p>

  <p>Similar examples might be taken from the description of almost
    all destructive earthquakes of which we have records. For a large
    earthquake to occur, and not to be accompanied by a train of succeeding
    earthquakes, is exceptional. Sometimes we find that a large number of
    small earthquakes have occurred without a large one being felt. Seismic
    storms of this description have happened, even in England—for instance,
    in the year 1750, which appears to have been a year of earthquakes for
    many portions of the globe.</p>

  <p>In this year, which is known as the ‘earthquake year,’ shocks were felt
    in England as follows: On March 14, in Surrey; March 18, in south-west
    of England; April 2, at Chester; June 7, at Norwich; August 23, in
    Lincolnshire; September 30, Northamptonshire.</p>

  <p><em>Synchronism of earthquakes.</em>—One of the first writers who drew
    attention to the fact that two shocks of earthquakes have been felt
    simultaneously at distant places was David Milne, who published a list
    of these occurrences.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

  <p>In two instances, February and March 1750, shocks were simultaneously
    felt in England and Italy. In September 1833 shocks appear to have been
    simultaneously felt in England and Peru. These and many other similar
    examples are discussed by Mallet, who thinks with Milne that these
    coincidences are in every probability matters of accident. According to
    Fuchs, Calabria and Sicily appear often to have had earthquakes at the
    same time, as for instance in 1169, 1535, 1638,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>when the town Euphemia
    sank, and in the years 1770, 1776, 1780, and 1783.</p>

  <p>A remarkable example of coincidence occurred on November 16, 1827, when
    a terrible earthquake was felt in Columbia, and at the same time a
    shock occurred on the Ochotsk plains, nearly antipodal to each other.</p>

  <p>Kluge also gives a large number of instances of simultaneous
    earthquakes; thus, on January 23, 1855, on the same day that
    Wellington, New Zealand, so severely suffered, there was a heavy
    earthquake in the Siebengeberge, and also in North America. To this
    might be added the fact that the last destructive earthquake in Japan
    occurred within a few days of this time.</p>

  <p>Sometimes neighbouring countries where earthquakes are common are
    equally remarkable by their utter want of synchronism. For example,
    Southern Italy and Syria are said never to be shaken simultaneously.</p>

  <p><em>Secondary earthquakes.</em>—Although it is possible that the simultaneous
    occurrence of earthquakes in distant regions may sometimes be a
    matter of chance, it must also be remarked that the shaking produced
    by one earthquake may be sufficient to cause ground which is in a
    critical state to give way, and thus the first disturbance becomes the
    originator of a second earthquake. Admitting that an earthquake, as
    it radiates from its centre, may act in such a manner, we see that a
    feeble disturbance might be the ultimate cause in the production of a
    destructive earthquake, just as the disturbance of a stone upon the
    face of a scarp might, by its impact upon other stones, cause many tons
    of material to be dislodged.</p>

  <p>It is also easy to conceive how the seismic activity of two districts
    may be dependent upon each other. Inasmuch as these secondary shocks
    are direct effects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
    primary disturbances, they might have been treated in a previous chapter.</p>

  <p>As examples of consequent or secondary earthquakes Fuchs tells us that
    when small earthquakes take place in Constantinople and Asia Minor,
    earthquakes are felt in Bukharest, Galazy, and Kronstadt.</p>

  <p>The great Lisbon earthquake also appears to have given rise to several
    consequent disturbances. One was in Derbyshire, occurring at 11 a.m.
    It was sufficiently violent to cause plaster to fall from the sides
    of a room and a chasm to open on the surface of the ground. Some
    miners working underground were so alarmed that they endeavoured to
    escape to the surface. During twenty minutes there were three distinct
    disturbances.</p>

  <p>Another shock was felt at Cork.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

  <p>Although these disturbances own a consequence of the Lisbon earthquake
    they might properly perhaps be attributed to the pulsations produced by
    the shock at Lisbon, which spread through England and other countries
    without being felt.</p>

  <p>The shocks which men felt in New Zealand and New South Wales in 1868
    were probably secondary shocks, due to the disturbance at Arequipa and
    other places on the South American coast.</p>

  <p>These so-called secondary earthquakes, although in many instances
    they may be due to earth pulsations produced by earthquake, or to the
    immediate sensible shaking of a large earthquake, may perhaps, in
    certain instances, be attributed to some widespread disturbance beneath
    the crust of the earth. The occurrence of periods where all earthquake
    countries suffer, unusual disturbances indicate the probability of such
    underground phenomena.</p>

      <span class="subhead">DISTRIBUTION OF EARTHQUAKES IN TIME (<i>continued</i>).</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <div class="summary">
    The occurrence of earthquakes in relation to the position of the
    heavenly bodies—Earthquakes and the moon—Earthquakes and the sun;
    and the seasons; the months—Planets and meteors—Hours at which
    earthquakes are frequent—Earthquakes and sun spots—Earthquakes
    and the aurora.</div>

  <p><em>The position of the heavenly bodies and the occurrence of
      earthquakes.</em>—Since the earliest times, in searching for the cause of
    various natural phenomena, man has turned his energies towards the
    heavens. One of the earliest observations was the connection that
    exists between the season of the year and the motions of the heavenly
    bodies. Tides were seen to be influenced by the moon. In later times
    it has been discovered that periods of maximum magnetic disturbances
    occur every ten or eleven years with the sun spots, and Herr Kreil, of
    Vienna, tells us our satellite, the moon, has also an influence upon
    the magnet.</p>

  <p>From day to day we see the bond connecting our planet with the sun, the
    moon, and other heavenly bodies which are outside us gradually becoming
    closer.</p>

  <p>Inasmuch as many phenomena, like the motion of the tides, the rise and
    fall of the barometer, fluctuations in temperature, are all more or
    less directly connected with the relative position of our planet with
    regard to the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
    and moon, any coincidence between the phases of
    these bodies and the occurrence of earthquakes more or less involves a
    time relationship with the other phenomena resultant on lunar and solar
    influences.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes and the position of the moon.</em>—Many earthquake
    investigators have attempted to show the connection between earthquakes
    and the phases of the moon.</p>

  <p>The first and most successful worker in this branch of seismology was
    Professor Alexis Perrey, of Dijon, who, after many years of arduous
    labour in tabulating and examining catalogues of earthquakes, showed
    that earthquakes were more likely to occur at the following periods
    than at others.</p>

  <p>1. They are more frequent at new or full moon (syzygies) than at half
    moon (quadratures).</p>

  <p>2. They are more frequent when the moon is nearest the earth (perigee)
    than when she is farthest off (apogee).</p>

  <p>3. They are more frequent when the moon is on the meridian than when
    she is on the horizon.</p>

  <p>These results were obtained by Perrey after analysing his catalogues
    by three different and independent methods, and they were confirmed
    by the report of a committee appointed by the Academy of Sciences. It
    must, however, be remarked that in several instances anomalies occur,
    and also that the difference between the number of earthquakes at any
    two periods is not a very large one. Thus, for instance, the annual
    catalogues compiled by Perrey from 1844 to 1847, the earthquakes in
    perigee are to those in apogee as 47 : 39. Between the years 1843 and
    1872 Perrey finds that 3,290 shocks occurred at the moon’s perigee, and
    3,015 at the apogee.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

  <p>Between 1761 and 1800 earthquakes occurred as follows:—</p>

  <p>The following table shows the results which enabled Perrey to deduce

  <p>Dividing the period of lunation into quarters, with the time of
    syzygies and quadratures as the centres of these quarters, he found
    that the earthquakes were distributed as follows.</p>

  <p>The reported earthquakes between 1751 and 1843 are shown to conform
    with the same rule.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Julius Schmidt, astronomer at Athens, found
    for the earthquakes of Eastern Europe and adjacent countries for the
    years 1776 to 1873 that there were more earthquakes when the moon was
    in perigee. Other maxima were at new moon, and two days after the first
    quarter. There was a diminution at full moon, and a minimum on the day
    of the last quarter. As one example of results which are antagonistic
    to the general results obtained by Perrey may be quoted the results of
    an examination by Professor W. S. Chaplin of the earthquake recorded at
    the meteorological observatory in Tokio. The list of earthquakes, 143
    in number, extending over a period of three years, was recorded by one
    of Palmieri’s instruments. The results were as follows:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

  <p>1. There have been maxima of earthquakes when the moon was two and
    nine hours east and seven hours west. At the upper transit there is a
    minimum.</p>

  <p>2. Considering the moon’s position with regard to the sun, at
    conjunction there were 32, at opposition 37, and at quadrature 74. East
    of the meridian the maximum was at least four hours.</p>

  <p>3. When the moon was north of the equator these were 68, when south 82.</p>

  <p>4. A maximum of earthquakes seven and eleven days after the moon’s
    perigee. The fact that these results were obtained for the earthquakes
    of a special small seismic area renders them more interesting.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

  <p><em>Frequency of earthquakes in relation to the position of the sun.</em>—The
    question as to whether there is a connection between the frequency of
    earthquakes and the relative position of the sun is to a great extent
    identical with the question as to the relative frequency of earthquakes
    in the various seasons. It is a subject which we find referred to
    by writers in the earliest ages. Pliny and Aristotle thought that
    earthquakes occurred chiefly in spring and autumn. In later times it
    has been a subject which has been most carefully considered by Merian,
    von Hoff, Perrey, Mallet, Volger, Kluge, and others who have devoted
    attention to seismology. In a résumé of the earthquakes of Europe, and
    of the adjacent parts of Asia and Africa, from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 306–1843,
    Mallet gives the following results:—</p>

  <p>The above periods were called by Perrey <em>critical epochs</em>, because
    as a general result of his researches he found that at such periods
    there was a greater frequency of earthquakes. Fuchs, quoting from
    Kluge’s tables, extending from 1850–1857, tells us that the recorded
    earthquakes occurred as follows:—</p>

  <p>
    In the Northern Hemisphere—
  </p>
  <table summary="Earthquakes in relation to sun north">
    <tr>
      <td class="tdl">Equinoxes</td>
      <td><b>1324</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="tdl">Solstices</td>
      <td>1202</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    In the Southern Hemisphere—

  <table summary="Earthquakes in relation to sun south">
    <tr>
      <td class="tdl">Equinoxes</td>
      <td><b>301</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="tdl">Solstices</td>
      <td>261</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Earthquakes are, therefore, more frequent at the equinoxes, and this
    especially at the autumnal equinox. In the northern hemisphere, at
    the solstices, the greater number of shocks occur about the winter
    solstices, whilst in the southern hemisphere, about the summer
    solstices.</p>

  <p>Exceptions, however, are found in Central America and the West Indies,
    in the Caucasus, and the Ægean Sea.</p>

  <p>The idea that earthquakes had a periodicity dependent upon the position
    of the heavenly bodies is by no means confined to Europe. In a Japanese
    work called ‘Jishin Setsu’ (an opinion about earthquakes) by a priest
    called Tensho, it is stated that the relative positions and movements
    of the twenty-eight constellations with respect to the moon cause
    earthquakes. This Tensho asserts after careful calculation, and Falb
    tells us that all future earthquakes can be predicted.</p>

  <p>In the Kuriles and Kamschatka, Sicily, and in parts of South America,
    it is said that the equinoxes are regarded as dangerous seasons.</p>

  <p><em>Frequency of earthquakes in relation to the seasons and months.</em>—What
    is here said respecting the relative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
    frequency of earthquakes at the
    different seasons and months is little more than an extension and
    critical examination of the results which have been given respecting
    the frequency of earthquakes in regard to the position of the sun.</p>

  <p>That there is a difference between the number of earthquakes which are
    felt at one season of the year as compared with those felt at another
    is a fact which, as seismoscopic observations are extended, is becoming
    more and more recognised.</p>

  <p>Some of the more important results which were arrived at by Mallet from
    5,879 observations made in the northern hemisphere, and 223 in the
    southern hemisphere, may be expressed as follows:—</p>

  <table class="collapse" summary="Earthquakes in relation to sun, hemispheres">

  <p>Julius Schmidt, of Athens, who so carefully examined the earthquakes of
    eastern Europe, came to the following conclusions:—</p>

  <p>For the earthquakes between 1200 and 1873, a maximum on September 26
    and January 17; a minimum on December 3 and June 13.</p>

  <p>For the earthquakes between 1873 and 1874, a maximum on March 1 and
    October 1; a minimum on July 7 and December 15.</p>

  <p>For all the earthquakes of eastern Europe, a maximum on January 3; a
    minimum on July 8, or there was a maximum at perihelion and aphelion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

  <p>When the months are grouped together according to the seasons, spring,
    summer, autumn, and winter, we find that in the northern hemisphere the
    minimum is in summer and the maximum in winter, whilst in the southern
    hemisphere (giving the proper months corresponding to its seasons) we
    find two maxima, one at the commencement of winter, and the other at
    midsummer, whilst the minima are in spring and autumn.</p>

  <p>Neglecting those records which show as many earthquakes for the winter
    months as for the summer months, we see at a glance that generally
    the greater number of shocks have happened during the colder seasons.
    In the southern hemisphere, so far as the records go, this is not
    true. In the northern regions, out of fourteen examples there are
    two exceptions. In the central regions there are two cases where the
    greatest number of earthquakes have been recorded in the winter months,
    and two cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
    where the greatest number have been recorded for the summer.</p>

  <p>Altogether, out of twenty-two examples, there are only six exceptions
    to the rule. These exceptions altogether occur among records many of
    which are ancient, and are, therefore, more open to error than lists
    which have been compiled in modern times.</p>

  <p>Because small earthquakes are seldom noticed by persons out in the
    open air, it might be expected that the number of earthquakes observed
    in warm countries at one portion of the year would be equal to those
    observed in any other season. Such an argument, however, would hardly
    apply to most of the records which are quoted, as they refer to
    destructive disturbances.</p>

  <p>If, however, we take the records made in tropical countries from the
    table just given, we see that in such countries there have been almost
    as many observations of earthquakes at one season as at any other.</p>

  <p>Another fact which might be adduced against the rule that the
    greater number of earthquakes occur during the winter months would
    be the comparison of a table of earthquakes recorded previous to the
    nineteenth century. By doing this we see that for certain countries the
    winter rule is inverted, and that the greater number of shocks are felt
    during the summer.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding these objections to Perrey’s conclusions, the balance
    of evidence is in favour of his general result, and we may conclude
    that during the colder portions of the year we may expect more shakings
    than during the warmer portions. Comparing the number of earthquakes of
    winter and autumn to those of summer and spring, they are to each other
    in the proportion of 4 : 3.</p>

  <p>A fairer way to examine this question, and to determine what is
    probably the present state of seismic activity in our globe, would
    be only to consider the earthquakes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> which have taken place in
    comparatively recent times, laying especial stress upon those
    observations which have been made with the assistance of automatic
    instruments, or those which have been collected by persons interested
    in these investigations.</p>

  <p>For this purpose the following table, showing the distribution of
    earthquakes in different countries during the nineteenth century, has
    been compiled.</p>

  <p>The arrangement is mensual. Where the number of earthquakes in any
    month is above the average, the number is printed in large type; where
    below the average, in small type.</p>

  <p>A glance at this table shows that for most countries in the northern
    hemisphere the rule that there are generally more earthquakes during
    the winter months—that is, from October to March—holds good. For
    countries which lie comparatively near to the Equator, and also for
    those countries in the southern hemisphere, the rule is not so clear.
    When examining this table it must be remembered that it does not enable
    us to judge of the relative frequency of earthquakes in different
    countries, inasmuch as the periods over which the records were taken
    are different in different cases.</p>

  <p>To the above table might be added the records of P. Merian, who
    examined the earthquakes felt in Basle up to 1831. As a result he
    found that during the winter months eighty shocks had been felt,
    whilst during the summer only forty. Taking the records for the two
    hemispheres from 1850–1857, compiled by Kluge,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> in the northern
    hemisphere we have in the months between October and March 948 shocks
    against 862 in the remainder of the year. In the same months in the
    southern hemisphere we have for the corresponding periods the numbers
    337 and 300, and thus both hemispheres would appear to follow the same
    rule. If, however, we examine the table we see that the two seasons
    are not so pronounced for the southern hemisphere as they are for
    the northern, and that there may be two or three periods of maximum
    disturbance as has been previously indicated.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes and the planets and meteors.</em>—Just as the moon and the sun
    may exert an attractive influence upon the earth and cause earthquakes
    to predominate at certain seasons rather than at others, several
    investigators of seismic phenomena have thought that the planets might
    act in a similar manner.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

  <p>M. J. Delauney, from a study of Perrey’s tables of earthquakes from
    1750–1842, found two groups of maxima each with a period of about
    twelve years, one commencing in 1759 and the other in 1756. Two
    other groups with twenty-eight year periods respectively commence in
    1756 and 1773. These groups coincide with the times when Jupiter and
    Saturn reach the mean longitudes of 265° and 135°. From this Delauney
    concludes that earthquakes have a maximum when the planets are in the
    mean longitudes just mentioned.</p>

  <p>The increased number of earthquakes, especially in November, are
    attributed to the passage of the earth through swarms of meteors, and
    in like manner supposes the influence of Jupiter and Saturn to be due
    to their passing through meteor streams situated in mean longitudes
    135° and 265°.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of this he predicts an increase of earthquakes in the
    years 1886, 1891, 1898, 1900, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. E. Naumann, who critically examined the large earthquakes of Japan,
    showed that there was an approximate coincidence between many of the
    disturbances and the thirty-three year period of meteoric showers.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

  <p>Humboldt states that a great shower of meteors was seen at Quito before
    the great earthquake of Riobamba (Feb. 4, 1797). The earthquakes of
    1766 and 1799 at Cumana are also said to have been accompanied with
    meteoric showers. Mallet gives a list of large earthquakes which
    occurred at the times when meteors were observed.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

  <p><em>The hours at which earthquakes are most frequent.</em>—From the
    examination of a catalogue of over 2,000 earthquakes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> which occurred
    in various parts of the world between the years 1850 and 1857, made by
    Kluge, it is found that both for the northern and southern hemispheres
    the observations which were made during the night generally exceed
    those which were made during the day.</p>

  <p class="noindent">In the northern hemisphere the greatest number were observed between 10
    <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 12 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> (360 shocks), and the fewest between
    12 and 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> (139 shocks). In the southern hemisphere, the
    greatest number were observed at night between 12 and 1, and the
    smallest number between 1 and 2 and 4 and 5 in the afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
    These distinctions, however, are less distinctly marked as we approach
    the Equator. Schmidt found for the earthquakes of the Orient between
    1774 and 1873, that shocks had been most frequent about half-past two
    <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and less frequent about 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> With regard
    to these conclusions, which have been reached with much labour, we
    might be inclined to think that they are partially to be explained on
    the supposition that more observations are made during the night than
    during the day—the personal experience of residents in an earthquake
    country being, that many earthquakes which occur during the day are
    passed by unnoticed, whilst those which occur during the night are
    recorded by thousands of observers. Such a view is certainly confirmed
    by the instrumental records obtained in Japan. From 1872 to 1880
    inclusive there were 261 shocks recorded, 132 of which occurred between
    the hours of 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes and sun spots.</em>—Of late years considerable attention
    has been drawn to a coincidence between the occurrence of sun spots,
    magnetic disturbances, rainfall, and other natural phenomena.</p>

  <p>These periods of sun spots occur about every eleven years, and appear
    to be coincident with the periodical return of the planet Jupiter. In
    Japan, Dr. E. Naumann sought for a coincidence between these periods of
    sun spots and earthquakes, but without any marked results.</p>

  <p>Schmidt, who carefully compared his lists of earthquakes with the
    appearance of sun spots, came to the conclusion that there was no
    marked coincidence. The occurrence of earthquakes had sometimes
    synchronised with sun spots, whilst at other times there had been a
    maximum of sun spots and no earthquakes.</p>

  <p>M. R. Wolf<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> apparently considers that earthquakes, like volcanic
    eruptions and the appearance of the aurora, are coincident with sun
    spots.</p>

  <p>Kluge, however, came to the conclusion that when there are few sun
    spots, earthquakes, like volcanic eruptions and magnetic disturbances,
    have been at a maximum.</p>

  <p>M. A. Poey, who examined a catalogue of the earthquakes of Mexico
    and the Antilles, extending from 1634 to 1870, shows by a table that
    earthquakes have come in groups, first at the maxima and then at the
    minima period of sun spots. Out of thirty-eight groups, seventeen
    being at the maximum and seventeen at the minimum, the remaining four
    are exceptions to the rule, being between the maximum and minimum.
    Phenomena which are dependent upon heat occur with the minima of sun
    spots, and those dependent upon cold with the maxima.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes and the aurora.</em>—The possible connection between
    earthquakes and the aurora is a subject which has attracted some
    attention. Boué has especially made a careful examination of this
    subject.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

  <p>He comes to the conclusion that if we compare the monthly periods of
    earthquake frequency and the aurora there is an agreement between
    the two. Comparing Perrey’s tables of earthquakes from the fourth to
    the nineteenth century, with tables of the aurora, one-third of both
    phenomena have occurred, not only in the same day, but often at the
    same hour. Between 1834 and 1847, 457 earthquakes are given and 351
    notices of the aurora.</p>

  <p class="mb0">Out of these:—</p>

  <div class="left ml5">
    48 occur on the same day,<br />
    &nbsp; 5 occur in the same hour,<br />
    30 approximate to the same time.
  </div>

  <p>The nearer together that these phenomena have occurred the stronger
    have they been.</p>

  <p>Professor M. S. di Rossi brings forward many examples where there
    has been a coincidence between the appearance of the aurora and
    earthquakes. On 139 nights out of 211 days the aurora was seen in
    some parts of Italy, and ninety-three times earthquakes were felt. On
    forty-six occasions earthquakes and aurora took place together.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In
    considering the probability of a connection existing between these two
    phenomena, we must bear in mind that the aurora is at no great height
    above the surface of our earth, and, further, that it can be partially
    imitated. The fact that in earthquake countries, like Japan, the aurora
    is practically never seen, would indicate that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>we can neither regard
    this imperfectly understood phenomenon either as an effect or cause
    of earthquakes. That earthquakes and the appearance of the aurora in
    certain countries should not sometimes coincide is an impossibility.</p>

  <p>Dr. Stukeley, who, it must be remembered, attempted to correlate
    the phenomena of earthquakes and electricity, when writing of the
    disturbances which shook England in 1849 and 1850, says that the
    weather had been unusually warm, the aurora borealis frequent and of
    unusually bright colours, whilst the whole year was remarkable for its
    fire-balls, lightnings, and corruscations.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

  <p>The aurora was observed before the commencement of the Maestricht
    earthquakes in 1751<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> whilst at the time of the shock flashes of
    light like lightning were observed in the sky.</p>

  <p>Glimmering lights were seen in the sky before the New England
    earthquakes (Nov. 18, 1755), and again, before the disturbances which
    occurred in the same region in 1727, peculiar flashes of light were
    seen.</p>

  <p>Preceding the Sicilian earthquake of 1692 strange lights were seen
    in the sky. Ignis fatui have also been observed with earthquakes. At
    the time of auroral displays Bertelli has observed microseismical
    disturbances, and M. S. di Rossi, who has made similar observations,
    thinks that there is an intimate connection between the aurora and
    earthquakes; the aurora either occurring in a period of earthquakes, or
    else taking the place of earthquakes.</p>

        AND EARTHQUAKES.</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p><em>Changes in the barometer and earthquakes.</em>—Mallet, who collected
    together a number of examples of earthquakes which have occurred with
    a fall of the barometer, and a number which have happened with a rise,
    concludes that there are as many instances of the one as of the other.
    At the great earthquake of Calabria, in 1783, the barometer was very
    low. The earthquake of the Rhine (February 23, 1828) was preceded by
    a gradual fall of the barometer, which reached its lowest point upon
    that day. After the earthquake the barometer again rose. The earthquake
    of February 22, 1880, in Japan, was accompanied by exactly similar
    phenomena. Caldcleugh, who observed the heavy shocks in Chili (February
    20, 1835), noticed that on February 17 and 18 the barometer fell 5/10
    inches. Similar phenomena were observed before the succeeding smaller
    shocks. After the shocks the barometer again rose. Principal Dawson,
    speaking of the earthquakes of Canada, observes that some of the shocks
    have been accompanied with a low barometer.</p>

  <p>P. Merian, who examined the connection between the Swiss earthquakes
    and atmospheric pressure, found that out of twenty-two earthquakes
    observed in Basle between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
    1755 and 1836, thirteen of these were
    local shocks, of which eight were accompanied with sudden changes of
    pressure. Of the remaining nine, which were only felt slightly in
    Basle, no change in atmospheric pressure was observed. Of thirty-six
    earthquakes which, between 1826 and 1836, were felt in Switzerland,
    thirty were chiefly confined to Switzerland, and ten of these occurred
    with a low or falling barometer.</p>

  <p>Humboldt is of opinion that earthquakes only occur with changes in
    barometric pressure in those countries where earthquakes are few; and
    he gives examples where the regular variations of the barometer have
    gone on without interruption at the time of earthquakes.</p>

  <p>Frederick Hoffmann, who examined fifty-seven earthquakes which occurred
    at Palermo between 1788 and 1838, came to the following result:—</p>

  <p>The observations of M. S. di Rossi apparently show that the earthquakes
    in Italy chiefly occur with a barometrical depression and with sudden
    jumps in atmospheric pressure.</p>

  <p>Schmidt, who examined the earthquakes of the Orient, which occurred
    between 1858 and 1873, says that they were rare with a high barometer,
    but numerous when the barometer was low.</p>

  <p>From an examination of a table of 396 earthquakes (May 8, 1875-Dec.
    1881) felt in Tokio, furnished to me by Mr. Arai Ikunosuke, the
    director of the meteorological department, I obtained the following

  </table>

  <p>From this it would appear that in Japan at least the movements of the
    barometer do not show any marked connection with the occurrence of
    earthquakes.</p>

  <p>When considering this question we must remember the marked effects
    which a lowering of the barometer produces upon certain volcanoes and
    solfataras. The volumes of steam emitted from Stromboli and from some
    of the solfataras in Tuscany hold a marked connection with atmospheric
    pressure as the quantity of fire damp given off from coal seams—these
    being greatest when the barometer is low. At certain changes of
    the weather it is said that the volcano of Vulture, near Melfi,
    emits noises. These phenomena at once place volcanic phenomena and
    barometrical pressure in direct relationship.</p>

  <p><em>Changes in temperature.</em>—If, with an earthquake, it should happen
    that there is a change in the height of the barometer, we should
    naturally expect that this might be accompanied with the changes in the
    temperature, in the wind, and in other atmospheric phenomena which are
    more or less connected with the height of the barometer.</p>

  <p>Many times it has been observed that after an earthquake there has been
    a sudden fall in the temperature. Such was the case with the Yokohama
    earthquakes of 1880.</p>

  <p>Cotte endeavours to show that the earthquakes of Lisbon produced a
    change upon the temperature of all Europe. In the year which followed
    this earthquake storms were more common than usual.</p>

  <p>Kluge has collected together a large number of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> examples when there has
    been a fall of temperature at the time of an earthquake.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

  <p>At Kiachta, in Siberia, at the time of the earthquake of December
    27, 1856, the thermometer fell from 12° to 25° R. We must, however,
    remember that there are many cases known where the thermometer rose.</p>

  <p>M. S. di Rossi remarks that we have the highest records of temperature
    in the years richest in earthquakes. Thus, in 1873, at the time of the
    earthquakes in Central and Northern Italy, an abnormal high temperature
    was remarked. Japanese writers have remarked upon the unusual heat
    which has shaken their countries. The temperature of subterranean
    waters have been known to increase before earthquakes.</p>

  <div class="summary">
    Want of synchronism between earthquakes and volcanic
    eruptions—Synchronism between earthquakes and volcanic
    eruptions—Conclusion.</div>

  <p><em>Connection between earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</em>—Insomuch as
    it is a recognised fact that regions which are characterised by their
    seismic activity are chiefly those which are also characterised by
    the number of their volcanoes, it is generally assumed that these
    two phenomena have an intimate relation. The residents in a volcanic
    country, when seeking for the origin of an earthquake, invariably turn
    towards the volcanoes which surround them. If a neighbouring volcano
    is in a state of activity, it is often regarded as a safeguard against
    seismic convulsions, in other cases it is looked upon as being the
    cause of such disturbances. In certain instances both of these views
    have apparently been corroborated. When we consider that an earthquake
    and a volcanic eruption may both be the result of some great internal
    convulsion, and that first one and then the other may take place in the
    same neighbourhood, it is natural to expect that when these internal
    forces have expended themselves in the production of one of these
    phenomena, it is not so likely that they should exhibit themselves in
    the other. The inhabitants of Sicily and Naples, we are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> told, regard
    eruptions of Etna and Vesuvius as safeguards against earthquakes. A
    similar belief is to be found in portions of South America with regard
    to the volcanoes for which that country is so celebrated.</p>

  <p>From an examination of the records of the large earthquakes and the
    volcanic eruptions which have taken place in Japan during the last
    2,000 years, Dr. Naumann found that there was often an approximate
    coincidence between the times of the occurrence of these phenomena,
    suggesting the idea that the efforts which had been sufficient to
    establish the volcano had at the same time been sufficient to shake the
    ground.</p>

  <p>Of destructive earthquakes which have occurred at the time of volcanic
    eruptions, and of examples when these phenomena have occurred at widely
    separated intervals, the records are extremely numerous.</p>

  <p><em>Want of synchronism between earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</em>—Many
    of the great earthquakes of South America do not appear to have been
    connected with volcanic eruptions.</p>

  <p>The great earthquakes of the world, like those of Calabria and Lisbon,
    which took place in regions which are not volcanic, have not, Fuchs
    tells us, taken place in conjunction with volcanic outbursts.</p>

  <p>In Japan, as in the Sandwich Islands and in many other parts of the
    globe, the small earthquakes which occur almost daily do not appear to
    show any marked connection with volcanic disturbances.</p>

  <p>In 1881, during the eruption of Natustake, a volcano lying about
    a hundred miles north of Tokio, there was neither an increase nor
    a decrease in the earthquakes which were felt in Tokio. Similar
    remarks apply to the state of seismic activity of 1876–77, when
    Oshima, a volcanic island about seventy miles to the south of Tokio,
    was in eruption.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
    In the Sandwich Islands Mauna Loa seems to have
    its eruptions independently of the disturbances which shake these
    islands.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

  <p><em>Synchronism of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</em>—Although many
    examples like the above may be quoted, which apparently show an utter
    want of connection between earthquakes and volcanoes, we must not
    overlook that class of earthquakes which almost invariably accompany
    all great volcanic disturbances. In fact the sudden explosions which
    take place at volcanic foci, as, for instance, at the commencement
    of an eruption, are enumerated as one of the causes which produce
    earthquakes. Earthquakes like these usually continue until the pressure
    of the steam and lava have found for themselves an opening. As compared
    with the total number of earthquakes which are recorded, they form but
    an insignificant portion.</p>

  <p>The direct connection which exists between these phenomena has, no
    doubt, done very much to spread the popular belief that all earthquakes
    may be connected with volcanic eruptions. As examples where this
    connection has existed we might quote from almost all the volcanic
    countries in the world.</p>

  <p>Thus, Fuchs tells us that on October 6, 1737, almost the whole of
    Kamschatka and the Kurile Islands were disturbed by movements which
    were simultaneous with the outbreak of the great volcano Klutschenskja
    of North Kamschatka.</p>

  <p>One of the earliest records of a severe earthquake and a volcanic
    eruption occurring simultaneously is found in the accounts of the
    destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The throwing up of Monte Nuovo
    in the neighbourhood of Pozzuoli was accompanied with a dreadful
    earthquake.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

  <p>In 1868 the earthquake of Arequipa was accompanied by the opening of
    the volcano Misti, on its north side. The distance to the volcano is
    about fourteen miles.</p>

  <p>At the time of the eruptions of Kilauea in 1789 the ground shook and
    rocked so that persons could not stand.</p>

  <p>The first eruption of the volcano Irasu, in Costa Rica (1783), was
    accompanied by violent earthquakes.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The smoke and flames which
    are said to have issued from the side of Mount Fojo at the time of the
    Lisbon earthquake are regarded by some as having been volcanic. Others
    thought that the phenomena, rather than being on the side of Fojo,
    which showed no traces of volcanic action, had taken place in the ocean.</p>

  <p>At the time of the great earthquake at Concepcion (1835), whilst the
    waves were coming in, two great submarine eruptions were observed. One,
    behind the Isle of Quiriquina, appeared like a column of smoke. The
    other, in the bay of San Vicente, appeared to form a whirlpool. The
    sea-water became black, and had a sulphurous smell, there being a vast
    eruption of gas in bubbles. Many fish were killed.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

  <p>With this same earthquake, near to Juan Fernandez, about one mile from
    the shore, the sea appeared to boil, and a high column of smoke was
    thrown into the air. At night flames were seen.</p>

  <p>In 1861, when Mendoza was destroyed and 10,000 inhabitants killed, a
    volcano at the foot of which Mendoza is situated burst into eruption.</p>

  <p>The earthquake of 1822 at Valdivia was accompanied by eruptions of the
    neighbouring mountains, which only lasted a few minutes.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Leghorn shocks (January 16–27, 1742) some fishermen
    observed a part of the sea to rage
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>violently, to raise itself to a
    great height, and then rush landwards.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

  <p>In 1797, when Riobamba was destroyed, the neighbouring volcanoes were
    not affected, but Mount Pasto, 120 miles distant, suddenly ceased to
    throw out its usual column of water.</p>

  <p>On the night of December 10, 1874, a strong shock was felt in New
    England, whilst at 4.45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on December 11 a shock was felt
    in the Pic du Midi, in the Pyrenees. In the middle of December there
    were volcanic outbursts in Iceland.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

  <p>It is possible that these occurrences might be the results of some
    widespread disturbance beneath the crust of the earth, or perhaps even
    of widely extended earth pulsations. The probability, however, is that
    these coincidences are accidental. When we remember that in a small
    area like the northern half of Japan alone there are periods when there
    are at least two shocks per day on the average, it is impossible for
    these coincidences not to exist. Less frequently coincidences between
    the larger disturbances must occur. Over and above these accidental
    coincidences, it would appear that in the world’s history periods
    have occurred when earthquakes were unusually frequent, and at such
    times distant countries have suffered simultaneously. This approximate
    coincidence in period, which has been referred to when speaking of the
    distribution of destructive earthquakes in historical time, does not
    imply an exact synchronism in the single shocks.</p>

  <p>Small earthquakes, or, more properly speaking, local tremblings, are a
    necessary accompaniment of almost all volcanic eruptions. Tremors of
    this description are seldom, however, felt beyond the crater, or at the
    most upon the flanks of the mountain where the eruption is going on.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

  <p>They are due to the explosive action of steam bursting through the
    molten lava.</p>

  <p><em>Volcanic eruption succeeding earthquakes.</em>—Sometimes it has happened
    that an earthquake, or a series of earthquakes, have terminated with
    the formation of volcanic vents.</p>

  <p>As an example of a volcanic outburst terminating a seismic disturbance,
    may be mentioned the appearance of a new volcano in the centre of
    Lake Ilopango, as a sequel to the shocks which had disturbed that
    neighbourhood in 1879.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

  <p>In 1750 there were continuous shakings lasting over three months at
    Manilla. These terminated with an eruption of a small island in the
    middle of a neighbouring lake. Three days after the commencement of
    this eruption, four other small islands rose in the same lake.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

  <p>Antonio d’Ulloa, when speaking of the Andes, remarks that after a
    volcanic eruption the shocks cease.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

  <p><em>Conclusion.</em>—Looking at this question generally, insomuch as the
    greatest number of volcanic eruptions appear, according to Fuchs,
    to have taken place in summer, whilst the greatest number of its
    earthquakes have apparently taken place in winter, it would seem that
    the two phenomena are without any direct connection, unless it be that
    both are different effects of a common cause.</p>

  <p>Regarded in this manner, an earthquake may be looked upon as an
    uncompleted effort to establish a volcano. To use the words of Mallet,
    ‘The forces of explosion and impulse are the same in both; they differ
    only in degree <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
    of energy, or on the varying sorts and degrees of
    resistance opposed to them.’<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

  <p>Although we have many examples of earthquakes having occurred without
    volcanic eruptions, and, on the other hand, of volcanic eruptions
    without earthquakes, volcanoes may still be regarded as ‘safety-valves
    of the earth’s crust,’ which, by giving relief to internal stresses,
    guard us against the effects of earthquakes.</p>

  <p>That many earthquakes are felt at Copiapo is attributed to the fact
    that in the neighbouring mountains there are no volcanic vents.</p>

  <p>We must not, however, overrate the protective influence of volcanoes.
    In the Sandwich Islands we see the columns of liquid lava in
    neighbouring mountains standing at different heights, indicating a
    want of subterranean connection between these vents. In consequence
    of this it would seem that enormous pressures might be generated in
    the neighbourhood of one of these mountains without finding relief at
    the other. When we have conditions like these, it would seem that the
    eruption of a volcano may have little or no influence in protecting
    neighbouring districts.</p>

  <p>This may possibly be the explanation of the fact that in 1835
    Concepcion was destroyed, notwithstanding there being an unusual
    activity in the volcanic vents of the neighbouring mountains.</p>

    Modern views respecting the cause of earthquakes—Earthquakes due
    to faulting—To explosions of steam—To volcanic evisceration—To
    chemical degradation—Attractive influence of the heavenly
    bodies—The effect of oceanic tides—Variation in atmospheric
    pressure—Fluctuation in temperature—Winds and earthquakes—Rain
    and earthquakes—Conclusion.</div>

  <p>As the results of modern inquiries respecting the cause of earthquakes,
    we see many investigators chiefly attributing these phenomena to
    special causes. A few attribute them to several causes. It seems to us
    that they might be attributed to very many causes which often act in
    a complex manner. The primary causes are telluric heats, solar heat,
    and variations in gravitating influences. These may be the principal,
    and sometimes the immediate, cause of an earthquake. The secondary
    causes are those dependent upon the primary causes, such as expansions
    and contractions of the earth’s crust, variations in temperature,
    barometrical pressure, rain, wind, the attractive influences of the
    sun and moon in producing tides in the ocean or the earth’s crust,
    variations in the distribution of stress upon the earth’s surface
    caused by processes of degradation, the alterations in the position of
    isogeothermal surfaces, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The part which may be played by these various causes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> in the production
    of oscillations, pulsations, and tremors will be referred to.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes consequent on faulting.</em>—In the chapter on Earth
    Oscillations, the causes producing the phenomena of elevation and
    depression are briefly indicated.</p>

  <p>By the variations in stress accompanying elevations and depressions,
    cracks are produced. Inasmuch as compression would crush the rocks
    constituting the earth’s crust, we must conclude with Captain Dutton
    that these cracks are formed by tension. By elevation, the upper rigid
    crust of the earth is stretched, and fissures are produced. The sudden
    formation of these fissures or faults gives rise to earthquakes, and
    perhaps also to volcanic vents. That earthquake and volcanic regions
    are situated on areas where there is evidence of rapid elevation is
    strikingly illustrated round the shores of the Pacific.</p>

  <p>Lasaulx considered that the earthquake of Herzogenrath was more
    or less intimately connected with the great mountain fissure—the
    <em>Feldbiss</em>—which crosses the coal region of the Wurm.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The sudden
    elevation or sinking of large areas at the time of an earthquake may be
    a consequence of these dislocations.</p>

  <p>It has already been pointed out that the earthquake region of Japan
    is the one where we have evidence of recent and rapid elevation. That
    certain earthquakes of this region may possibly be the result of
    faulting we have the evidence of our senses and of our instruments. The
    sudden blows and jolts which are sometimes felt are indicative of the
    sliding of one mass of rock across another.</p>

  <p>Should the ground be simply torn asunder, this tearing would give rise
    to a series of waves of distortion, vibrating in directions parallel
    to the plane of the fissure. Supposing this motion to be propagated
    to a number of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
    surrounding stations, it would be recorded at each of
    these as having the same direction. To those situated on a line forming
    a continuation of the strike of the fissure, the vibrations would
    advance so to speak <em>end on</em>, whilst to those stations lying in a line
    perpendicular to the strike of the fissure, the motion would advance

  <p>Motions like these latter have been recorded in Tokio, where
    earthquakes which from time observations were known to have come from
    the faulted and rising region to the south have been registered as a
    series of east and west motions, or vibrations transverse to this line
    of propagation.</p>

  <p>It must, however, be here mentioned that the registration of only
    transverse motion may possibly be due to the extinction of normal
    motion, although this is not generally regarded as probable.</p>

  <p>It would therefore appear that certain earthquakes and faults are
    closely related phenomena, the former being an immediate effect of
    the latter. Faults are due to earth oscillations, and to a variety of
    causes producing disturbances in the equilibrium of the earth’s crust;
    the principal cause of all these phenomena being alterations in the
    distribution of heat, and the attractive force of gravity.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes consequent on the explosion of steam.</em>—Humboldt regarded
    volcanoes and earthquakes as the results of a common cause, which he
    formulated as ‘the reaction of the fiery interior of the earth upon
    its rigid crust.’ Certain investigators, who have endeavoured to
    reduce Humboldt’s explanation to definite limits, have suggested that
    earthquakes may be due to sudden outbursts of steam beneath the crust
    of the earth, and its final escape through cracks and fissures.</p>

  <p>Admitting that steam may accumulate by separating
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> out from the cooling
    interior of our globe, its sudden explosion might be brought about by
    its own expansive force, or by the movements in the bubbling mass from
    which it originated.</p>

  <p>Others, however, rather than regard the steam as being a primeval
    constituent of the earth’s interior, imagine it arises from the gradual
    percolation of water from the surface of the earth down to volcanic
    foci, into which it is admitted against opposing pressures, by virtue
    of capillary action.</p>

  <p>Mallet, in his account of the Neapolitan earthquake, shows that the
    whole of the observed phenomena can be accounted for by the admission
    of steam into a fissure, which by the expansive force exerted on its
    walls was rent open. Just as at the Geysers we hear the thud and
    feel the trembling produced by the sudden evolution and condensation
    of steam, so may steam by its sudden evolution and condensation in
    the ground beneath us give rise to a series of shocks of varying
    intensity, accompanied by intermediate vibratory motions—that is to
    say, a motion which, as judged of by our feelings, is not unlike many
    earthquakes. Often it may happen that the result of the explosion may
    be the production of a fault, or at least a fissure; and thus in the
    resulting movements we may have a variety of vibrations, some being
    those of compression and distortion, produced by the blow of the
    explosion, and others being those of distortion alone, produced by the
    shearing action which may have taken place by the opening of the fault.
    Sometimes one set of these vibrations may be prominent, and sometimes
    the other. Thus, when we say that an earthquake has shown evidence by
    the nature of its vibrations that it was produced by a fault, this
    by no means precludes the possibility that an explosion of steam may
    also have been connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
    with the production of the disturbance.
    Mallet threw out the suggestion that the opening of fissures beneath
    the ocean might admit water to volcanic foci. During the time that the
    water was in the spheroidal state, the preliminary tremors, so common
    to many earthquakes, would be produced. These would be followed by the
    explosion, or series of explosions, constituting the shock or shocks of
    the earthquakes.</p>

  <p>The chief reasons for believing that the earthquakes of North-Eastern
    Japan are partly due to explosive efforts are:—</p>

  <p>1. That the greater number of disturbances, perhaps ninety per cent.,
    originate beneath the sea, where we may imagine that the ground,
    under the superincumbent hydrostatic pressure, is continuously being
    saturated with moisture.</p>

  <p>2. Many of the diagrams show that the prominent vibrations, of which
    there are usually from one to three, in a given disturbance have the
    same character as those produced by an explosive like dynamite, the
    greatest and probably the most rapid motions being inwards towards the
    origin.</p>

  <p>It may here be remarked that a very large proportion of the destructive
    earthquakes of the world have originated beneath the sea, as has often
    been testified by the succeeding sea waves. Also, it must be observed,
    that earthquake countries, like volcanic countries, are chiefly those
    which have a coast line sloping at a steep angle beneath the sea—that
    is to say, earthquakes are frequent along coasts bordered by deep water.</p>

  <p>The earthquakes which occur at volcanic foci constitute another class
    of disturbances which may be accredited to the explosive efforts of
    steam.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes due to volcanic evisceration.</em>—By the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span> ejection of ashes
    and lava from volcanic vents, there is an extensive evisceration of
    the neighbouring ground. When we look at a volcano like Fujiyama,
    13,000 feet in height, and at least fifty miles in circumference, and
    remember that the mass of cinders and slag of which it is composed
    came from beneath the area on which it rests, the point to be wondered
    at is, that earthquakes, consequent on the collapse of subterranean
    hollows, are not more frequent than they are. At the time of a single
    eruption of a volcano, the quantity of lava ejected amounts to many
    thousand millions of cubic feet. In 1783 the quantity of lava ejected
    from Skaptas Joknee, in Iceland, was estimated as surpassing ‘in
    magnitude the bulk of Mont Blanc.’<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Admitting that hollow spaces
    are the results of these eruptions, and that in consequence of this
    evisceration the ground is rendered unstable, the instability being
    increased by the additional load placed above the eviscerated area, it
    would seem that from time to time earthquakes are inevitable.</p>

  <p>Facts, however, teach us that volcanoes act as safety valves, and
    that, as a rule, at or shortly after an eruption, earthquakes cease.
    The relationship of earthquakes to volcanic eruptions would therefore
    indicate, notwithstanding the arguments put forward to show that an
    area loaded by a volcano has in consequence of the evisceration and the
    load a quaquaversal dip, that evisceration does not take place beneath
    volcanoes as is usually supposed, and we may conclude that it is but
    few earthquakes which have an origin due to these causes.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes and evisceration by chemical degradation.</em>—A powerful
    agent, which tends to the formation of subterranean hollows, is
    chemical degradation. The effects of this have been often measured by
    quantitative <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
    analysis of the solid materials which are daily carried
    away by many of our springs. In limestone districts this is very great.
    Prof. Ramsay estimates that the mineral matter discharged annually by
    the hot springs of Bath is equivalent in bulk to a column 140 feet in
    height and 9 feet in diameter. At San Filippo, in Tuscany, the solid
    matter discharged from the springs has formed a hill a mile and a
    quarter long, a third of a mile broad, and 250 feet in thickness.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
    Many other examples of subterranean chemical degradation will be found
    in text-books of geology.</p>

  <p>By this chemical action large cavernous hollows are produced. Beneath
    a volcano it is probable that liquid material immediately takes the
    place of that which is ejected, and that hollows are not formed as in
    the case of chemical degradation. If a cavern becomes too large, it
    eventually collapses.</p>

  <p>Of the falling in of large excavations we have examples in large mines.
    As a consequence, not only is a trembling produced, but also a noise,
    which is so like that produced by certain earthquakes that the South
    American miners have but one word, ‘bramido,’ to express both.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

  <p>Boussingault, who was an advocate for the theory that many earthquakes
    are produced by the sinking of the ground, calls attention to the fact
    that we have evidences of the subsidence of great mountains, like
    the Andes, the districts around which are so well known for their
    earthquakes. Capac Urcu is one of these mountains which legends tell us
    has decreased in height.</p>

  <p>The variation in the height of mountains is a subject which deserves
    attention. That mountains may possibly be hollow, we have the
    remarkable results attained by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
    Captain Herschel, who found that the
    attractive force of gravity in the neighbourhood of the Himalayas was
    not so great as it ought to have been had these mountains been solid.
    The Rev. O. Fisher gives another explanation of this phenomenon.
    Palmieri considers that the terrible earthquake which devastated
    Casamicciola (1881) was due to the hot springs having gradually eaten
    out cavernous spaces beneath the town. The extremely local character of
    this shock was certainly favourable to such a view.</p>

  <p>The earthquake which, in 1840, caused Mount Cernans, in the Jura, to
    fall, is also attributed to the solvent action of waters in undermining
    its foundations. This undermining action was in great measure probably
    due to a large spring, which, twenty-five years previously, had
    disappeared, and which subsequently may possibly have been slowly
    disintegrating the foundations of the mountain. Earthquakes of this
    order would be principally confined to districts where there are rocks
    which are more or less soluble, as, for instance, rock salt, gypsum,
    and limestone.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes and the attractive influences of the heavenly bodies.</em>—The
    most important attractions exercised upon our planet are those due to
    the sun and moon. To these influences we owe the tides in our ocean,
    and possibly elastic tides in the earth’s crust. Some theorists would
    also insist upon liquid tides in the fluid interior of our earth. The
    nature of the earth’s interior is, however, a question on which there
    is a diversity of opinion.</p>

  <p>One doctrine, which, until recent years, received much support, was
    that the interior of the earth was a reservoir of molten matter
    contained within a thin crust. Hopkins showed that the least
    possible thickness of such a crust must be from 800 or 1,000 miles,
    otherwise the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
    motions of precession and nutation would be subject to interference.</p>

  <p>M. Delauney objected to the views of Hopkins, on the supposition that
    the fluid interior of the earth had a certain viscosity.</p>

  <p>Sir William Thomson arrives at the conclusion that the earth on the
    whole must be more rigid than a continuous solid globe of glass. Mr.
    George H. Darwin’s investigations on the bodily tides of viscous or
    semi-elastic spheroids tend to strengthen the arguments of Sir William
    Thomson.</p>

  <p>Some philosophers hold the view that the central portion of the earth,
    although intensely hot, is solid by pressure, whilst the outer crust is
    solid by cooling. Between the two there is a shell of liquid or viscous
    molten matter.</p>

  <p>Another argument is, that although the interior of the globe may be
    solid, it is only retained in that condition by an immense pressure, on
    the relief of which it is liquefied—it is potentially liquid.</p>

  <p>As these views, and the arguments for and against them, are to be
    found in all modern text-books of geology, we will at once proceed
    to consider the effect of solar and lunar attractive influences in
    producing earthquakes upon a globe which is either solid, partially
    solid, or which has an interior wholly liquid.</p>

  <p><em>Effect of the attractive influences of the sun and moon.</em>—In 1854
    M. F. Zantedeschi put forward the view—that it is probable there is
    a continual tendency of the earth to protuberance in the direction
    of the radii vectores of the two luminaries which attract it. In
    consequence of these protuberances, pendulums ought at one time to
    swing more slowly than at others. Zantedeschi remarks that the periods
    of earthquakes appear to confirm
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> such a view, insomuch as they occur
    more often at the syzygies, or epoch of the spring tides, than at neap
    tides—an observation found in the works of Georges Baglivi (1703) and
    Joseph Toaldo (1770).<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

  <p>Prof. Perrey, of Dijon, who did so much for seismology, held the view
    that the preponderance in the number of earthquakes felt at particular
    seasons was possibly due to the attractive influence of the sun and
    moon producing a tide in the fluid interior of the earth, which, acting
    on the solid crust, produced fractures.</p>

  <p>Rudolf Falb, whose writings have of late years attracted considerable
    attention, brings forward views which may be regarded as amplifications
    of those suggested by Perrey.</p>

  <p>According to Falb, the inner portion of the earth must be regarded as
    fluid. In the crust above this fluid reservoir are cracks and channels,
    into which, by the attraction of the moon and sun, the fluid is drawn.
    On entering these cracks cooling takes place, together with explosions
    of gas and subterranean volcanic disturbances. The attractions
    producing the internal tides required by Falb are chiefly dependent
    upon the following factors:—</p>

  <p>1. The nearness and distance of the sun from the earth (January 1 and
    July 1).</p>

  <p>2. The position of the moon with regard to the earth, which in every
    twenty-seven days is once near and once distant.</p>

  <p>3. The phases of the moon—whether full or new moon (syzygies), or
    whether first or last quarter (quadratures).</p>

  <p>4. The equinoxes, the position of the sun in the equator, and the
    relative position of the earth.</p>

  <p>5. The position of the moon relative to the equator.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

  <p>6. The concurrence of the ‘centrifugal force’ of the earth with the
    last quarter of the moon.</p>

  <p>7. The entrance of the moon on the ecliptic—the so-called nodes.</p>

  <p>Assuming that earthquakes are wholly consequent on these attractions,
    it at once becomes possible to predict their occurrence. This Falb
    does, and when his predictions have been fulfilled he has certainly
    gained notoriety.</p>

  <p>He commenced by the predictions of great storms. In 1873 he predicted
    the destructive earthquake of Belluno, which earned for himself a
    eulogistic poem, which he has republished in his ‘Gedanken und Studien
    über Vulkanismus.’ After this, in 1874, he predicted the eruption of
    Etna. He also explained why, in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 4000, there should have
    been a great flood, and for <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 6400 he predicts a repetition
    of such an occurrence.</p>

  <p>When we approach the question of the extent to which the attraction
    of the sun and moon may influence the production of earthquakes, a
    question which we have to answer is, whether it is likely that the
    attractive power of the moon is so great that it could draw up the
    crust the earth beyond its elastic limits. We know what it can do with
    water. It can lift up a hemispherical shell 8,000 miles in diameter
    about two or three feet higher at its crown than it lifts the earth.
    Even supposing the solid crust to be lifted 100 times the apparent
    rise of the tide, is it likely that a hemispherical arch 8,000 miles
    in diameter when it is raised 200 feet at its crown could by any
    possibility suffer fracture? If an arch is 12,000 miles in length, all
    that we here ask is, whether the materials which compose the arch are
    sufficiently elastic to allow themselves to be so far stretched that
    the crown may be raised 200 feet. The result which we should arrive
    at is apparently so obvious that actual calculation seems hardly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
    necessary. If we regard the earth as being solid, the question resolves
    itself into the inquiry as to whether a column of rock, which is equal
    in length to the diameter of the earth, or about 8,000 miles, can be
    elongated 200 feet without a fracture. This is equivalent to asking
    whether a piece of rock one yard in length can be stretched one seventy
    thousandth of a foot. Considering that this is a quantity which is
    scarcely appreciable under the most powerful of our microscopes, we
    must also regard this as a question which it is hardly necessary to
    enter into calculations about before giving it an answer. To vary
    the method of treating such a question, may we not ask what is the
    utmost limit to which it would be possible to raise up or stretch the
    crust of the earth without danger of a fracture? Thus, for instance,
    to what extent might a column of rock be elongated without danger
    of its being broken? From what we know of the tenacity of materials
    like brick and their moduli of elasticity, it would seem possible to
    stretch a bar of rock 8,000 miles in length for approximately half
    a mile before expecting it to break. As to whether there is a wave,
    the height of which is equal to half this quantity, running round our
    earth as successive portions of its surface pass beneath the attracting
    influences of the sun and moon, is a phenomenon which, if it exists,
    would probably long ago have met with a practical demonstration.</p>

  <p>The deformation which a solid globe or spherical shell would
    experience under the attractive influences of the sun and moon has
    been investigated by Lamé, Thomson, Darwin, and other physicists and
    mathematicians.</p>

  <p>A conclusion that we are led to as one result of these valuable
    investigations is, that if the interior of the earth be fluid, and
    covered with a thin shell, then enormous
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span> elastic tides must be
    produced. A consequent phenomenon, dependent on the existence of these
    tides, would be a marked regularity in the occurrence of earthquakes.
    As this marked regularity does not exist, we must conclude that
    earthquakes are not due to the attractive influences of the sun and
    moon acting upon the thin crust of the earth covering a fluid interior.
    The periodicity of earthquakes corroborates the conclusions of Sir
    William Thomson, who remarks that if the earth were not extremely rigid
    the enormous elastic tides which must result would be sufficient to
    lift the waters of the ocean up and down so that the oceanic tide would
    be obliterated.</p>

  <p>Assuming that the earth has the rigidity assigned to it by mathematical
    and physical investigators, we nevertheless have travelling round our
    earth, following the attractions of the moon and sun, a tidal stress.
    This stress, imposed upon an area in a critical state, may cause it to
    give way, and thus be the origin of an earthquake. Earthquakes ought
    therefore to be more numerous when these stresses are the greatest.</p>

  <p>The periods of maximum stress or greatest pull exerted by the moon and
    sun will occur when these bodies are nearest to our planet—that is, in
    perigee and perihelion, and again when they are acting in conjunction
    or at the syzygies. That earthquakes are <em>slightly</em> more numerous
    at these particular periods than at others is a strong reason for
    believing that the attractions of the moon and sun enter into the list
    of causes producing these phenomena.</p>

  <p>Had there been a strongly marked distinction in the number of
    earthquakes occurring at these particular seasons as compared with
    others, we might have attributed earthquakes to the existence of
    elastic tides of a sensible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
    magnitude. As the facts stand, it appears
    that the maximum pulls exerted by the moon and sun are only sufficient
    to cause a slight preponderance in the number of earthquakes felt at
    particular seasons, and therefore that these pulls only result in
    earthquakes when the distorting effort has been exerted on an area
    which, by volcanic evisceration, the pressure of included gases, and
    other causes, is on the verge of yielding.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquakes and the tides.</em>—If we assume that earthquakes are in many
    cases due to the overloading of an area and its consequent fracture,
    such loading may occur by the rising of the tide. A belief that the
    earthquakes of Japan were attributable to the tides may be found in the
    diary of Richard Cocks under the date November 7, 1618, who remarks:—</p>

  <p>‘And, as we retorned, about ten aclock, hapned a greate earthquake,
    which caused many people to run out of their howses. And about the lyke
    hower the night following hapned an other, this countrey being much
    subject to them. And that which is comunely markd, they allwais hapen
    at a hie water (or full sea); so it is thought it chauseth per reason
    is much wind blowen into hollow caves under ground at a loe water, and
    the sea flowing in after, and stoping the passage out, causeth these
    earthquakes, to fynd passage or vent for the wind shut up.’<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

  <p>Although we may not acquiesce in Cock’s views respecting the imprisoned
    wind, it would seem that a comparison of the occurrence of earthquakes
    and the state of the tide would be a legitimate research. Inasmuch
    as the stresses which are brought to bear upon an area by the rising
    of the tide are so very much greater than those due to barometrical
    changes, it is not unlikely <span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
    that a marked connection would be found.
    But it must be remembered that because researches, so far as they have
    gone, tend to show that earth movements are more frequent when an area
    is relieved of a load, it is not unlikely that the greatest number of
    earthquakes may be found to occur at low water. Prof. W. S. Chaplin
    attempted to make this investigation in Japan, but not being able to
    obtain the necessary information respecting the tides, was compelled to
    relinquish this interesting work.</p>

  <p>Every foot of rise in a tide is equivalent to a load being placed on
    the area over which the tide takes place of sixty-two pounds to the
    square foot. This load is not evenly distributed, but stops abruptly at
    a coast line. Lastly, it may be observed that many coast lines are not
    simultaneously subjected to stresses consequent upon this load. Japan,
    for instance, may be regarded as an arch placed horizontally. The
    area near the crown of this arch is loaded by the tidal wave crossing
    the Pacific before the areas near the abutment, and farther there is
    a horizontal pressure at the crown which, if Japan were like a raft,
    would tend, as the tide advanced, to straighten its bow-like form, but
    as the wave passed its abutments to increase its curvature.</p>

  <p>Prof. G. Darwin has calculated the amount of rise and fall of a shore
    line due to tidal loads (see <a href="#Page_336">p. 336</a>, ‘Earth Pulsations’). The result
    of these calculations apparently indicates that these loads may have a
    considerable influence upon the stability of an area in a more or less
    critical condition.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. Carruthers suggests that tidal action may hold a general but
    indirect relationship to volcanic and seismic action by the retardation
    it causes on the earth’s rotation. By this retardation the polar axis
    tends to lengthen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
    tensile stresses are induced, resulting in
    fracture. The fluid interior of the earth, being no longer restrained,
    would move polewards, and, leaving equatorial portions unsupported,
    this would gradually collapse. The primary fractures would be north and
    south, while the secondary fractures would be east and west.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

  <p>That the rise of the tide is accompanied by a greater percolation
    of water to volcanic foci, which, in consequence, assume a greater
    state of activity, is a theory which was advanced many years ago. To
    determine how far tides may directly be connected with earthquakes, the
    necessary records have yet to be examined.</p>

  <p><em>Variations in atmospheric pressure.</em>—When we consider the immense
    load which, by a sudden rise of the barometer, is placed upon the area
    over which this rise takes place, it is not difficult to imagine that
    this rise may occasionally be the final cause which makes the crust of
    the earth to give way. A barometric rise of an inch is equivalent to a
    load of about seventy-two pounds being put upon every square foot of
    area over which this rise takes place. On the other hand, a fall in the
    barometric column indicates that a load has been removed, and whatever
    elastic effort may be exerted by subterranean forces in endeavouring to
    escape, being met by less resistance, they may burst these bonds, and
    an earthquake will result. For reasons such as these the final cause
    of earthquakes has often been attributed to variations in atmospheric
    pressure. In Japan there are practically as many earthquakes with a
    high barometer as with a low one.</p>

  <p>The extent to which barometric fluctuations have acted as final causes
    in the production of earthquakes may be judged of by a comparison of
    the times of barometric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
    variation and the times at which earthquakes have occurred.</p>

  <p>Three important laws of barometric variation are the following:—</p>

  <p>1. In the world generally the average barometric pressure is highest in
    winter. (Exceptions occur near Iceland and in the North Pacific.)</p>

  <p>2. The summer and winter monthly mean barometer differs least near the
    equator and over the great oceans. They differ most over the great
    continents and generally with increasing latitude.</p>

  <p>3. The greatest number of barometrical fluctuations usually take place
    in winter.</p>

  <p>Inasmuch as there are generally more earthquakes in winter than in
    summer, the first of these laws would indicate that this might be due
    to the greater load which acts upon the crust of the earth at that
    season. The second law would indicate that the distinction between
    the winter and summer earthquakes ought to be most marked in high
    latitudes, which, if we refer to the table on p. 257, we observe to be
    borne out by the results of observation. The countries where there are
    as many earthquakes in winter as in summer are chiefly those in low
    latitudes. The number of these countries from which we have records
    are, however, few.</p>

  <p>Facts opposed to the idea that earthquakes may be caused by an increase
    of barometric pressure are the results of observations like those of
    Schmidt and Rossi, which show that earthquakes chiefly occur with a low
    barometer.</p>

  <p>Assuming that these latter observations will be found by future
    investigators to be generally true, we must conclude that the relief
    of atmospheric pressure has an influence upon the occurrence of
    earthquakes. Such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
    conclusion would partially accord with the third
    barometrical law, or the fact that there are more occasions on which we
    get a low barometer during the winter months.</p>

  <p>Other writers who have examined this question are Volger, Kluge,
    Andrès, and Poly. The latter investigator sought a connection between
    earthquakes and revolving storms, in the centres of which there is
    usually an abnormal decrease of atmospheric pressure. If an area over
    which such a sudden change in pressure took place was in a critical
    state, it is not difficult to see that storms such as Poly refers to
    might sometimes be accompanied by earthquakes.</p>

  <p><em>Fluctuations in temperature.</em>—Inasmuch as fluctuations in temperature
    are governed by the sun, it may at once be said that there is a
    connection between earthquakes and readings of the thermometer.
    Certainly earthquakes occur mostly during the cold months or in
    winter. Similarly, as changes in temperature are so closely connected
    with barometric fluctuations, and these are said to have a direct
    influence upon the yielding of the earth’s crust, seismic phenomena are
    indirectly linked to fluctuations in temperature. A rise in temperature
    is usually accompanied by a fall in the barometer, and this in turn may
    be a condition favourable for the occurrence of an earthquake.</p>

  <p>If we regard solar heat as an agent causing expansions or contractions
    in the earth’s crust, then fluctuations in temperature become an
    immediate cause of earthquakes. The probability, however, is that
    solar heat has little or no connection with the final cause producing
    earthquakes, although at the same time coincidences between the
    occurrence of earthquakes and unusual fluctuations in temperature may
    from time to time be observed.</p>

  <p><em>Winds and earthquakes.</em>—Although it may be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> admitted that high winds
    exert enormous pressures upon mountain ranges, and might occasionally
    give rise to stresses causing rocky masses in unstable equilibrium to
    give way, the coincidences which have been established between the
    occurrence of storms and earthquakes can usually only be regarded as
    occurrences which have synchronised by chance.</p>

  <p>Storms are usually accompanied with a barometric depression, and the
    relation of diminutions in atmospheric pressure to earthquakes has been
    discussed.</p>

  <p><em>Rain and earthquakes.</em>—It has already been shown that earthquakes
    have occasionally been found to coincide with rain and rainy seasons.
    Whether the saturation of the ground with moisture or the percolation
    of the same to volcanic foci may be a direct effect producing
    earthquakes it is difficult to say. The probability, however, is
    that, rain being dependent on phenomena like changes in temperature,
    barometric fluctuations, and winds, we must regard it and the
    earthquakes which happen to coincide with these precipitations of
    moisture as congruent effects of more general causes.</p>

  <p><em>Conclusion.</em>—Although it would be an easy matter to discuss the
    relationship of earthquakes and other phenomena, we must conclude
    that the primary cause of earthquakes is endogenous to our earth, and
    that exogenous phenomena, like the attraction of the sun and moon and
    barometric fluctuations, play but a small part in the actual production
    of these phenomena, their greatest effect being to cause a slight
    preponderance in the number of earthquakes at particular seasons. They
    may, therefore, sometimes be regarded as final causes. The majority of
    earthquakes are due to explosive efforts at volcanic foci. The greater
    number of these explosions take place beneath the sea, and are probably
    due to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
    admission of water through fissures to the heated rocks
    beneath. A smaller number of earthquakes originate at actual volcanoes.
    Some earthquakes are produced by the sudden fracture of rocky strata or
    the production of faults. This may be attributable to stresses brought
    about by elevatory pressure. Lastly, we have earthquakes due to the
    collapse of underground excavations.</p>

  <div class="summary">
    General nature of predictions—Prediction by the observation of
    unusual phenomena (alteration in the appearance and taste of
    springs; underground noises; preliminary tremors; earthquake
    prophets—warnings furnished by animals, &amp;c.)—Earthquake warning.</div>

  <p><em>General nature of predictions.</em>—Ever since seismology has been
    studied, one of the chief aims of its students has been to discover
    some means which would enable them to foretell the coming of an
    earthquake, and the attempts which have been made by workers in various
    countries to correlate these occurrences with other well-marked
    phenomena may be regarded as attempts in this direction.</p>

  <p>Ability to herald the approach of these calamities would unquestionably
    be an inestimable boon to all who dwell in earthquake-shaken countries,
    and the attempts which have been made both here and in other places are
    extremely praiseworthy. In almost all countries where earthquakes are
    of common occurrence these movements of the earth have been more or
    less connected with certain phenomena which, in the popular mind, are
    supposed to be associated with an approach of an earthquake.</p>

  <p>If predictions were given in general terms, and they only referred
    to time, inasmuch as on the average there are in the world several
    shakings per day, we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
    always find that predictions were
    verified. We might even go further and predict that on certain days
    earthquakes would occur in certain countries, and still find that in
    many instances our supposed power of foresight had not deceived us.
    Thus, for instance, in Japan, where on the average there are probably
    one or two shakings every day, if prognostications were never correct
    there would be a violation of the laws of chance.</p>

  <p>What is required from those who undertake to forewarn us of an
    earthquake is an indication not only of the time at which the
    disturbance will happen, but also an indication of the area in which
    it is to occur. Those who dwell in an area where there are certain
    well-defined periods during which seismic activity is at a maximum—if
    ten or fourteen days should have passed without a shock—might, in many
    instances, find that a prophecy that there would be an earthquake
    within the next few days would prove itself correct. Also, if a severe
    shock had taken place, a prophecy that there would be a second or
    third smaller disturbance within a short period would also meet with
    verification.</p>

  <p>Certain persons with whom I am intimate appear to have persuaded
    themselves that they can foretell the coming of an earthquake by the
    sultry state of the atmosphere or a certain oppressiveness they feel,
    and an instinctive feeling arises that an earthquake is at hand.</p>

  <p>It is said that a few minutes before many of the shocks which shook
    New England between 1827 and 1847 people could foretell the coming
    disturbance by an alteration in their stomach.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> No doubt many who
    dwell in earthquake countries, and have been alarmed by earthquakes,
    are at times subject to nervous expectancy.</p>

  <p>The author has had such sensations himself, due, perhaps,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> to a
    knowledge that it was the earthquake season, that there had been no
    disturbance for some weeks, and a consequent increasing state of
    nervous presentments. In consequence of this, not only has he carefully
    prepared his instruments for the coming shock, but he has written and
    telegraphed to friends to do the same.</p>

  <p>Sometimes these guesses have proved correct. One remarkable instance
    was a few hours prior to the severe shock of February 22, 1880, when
    he communicated with his friends in Yokohama and asked them to see
    that their instruments were in good order. Oftener, however, his
    prognostications have been incorrect. The point in connection with
    this subject which he wishes to be remarked is, that the instances
    where earthquakes occurred shortly after the receipt of his letters
    are carefully remembered, and often mentioned, but the instances in
    which earthquakes did not occur appear to be entirely forgotten. He is
    led to mention these facts because they appear to be an experimental
    proof of what has taken place in bygone times, and what still takes
    place, especially amongst savages—namely, that the record of that which
    is remarkable survives, whilst that which is of every-day occurrence
    quickly dies. Had the records of all prognostications been preserved,
    the probability is that we should find that they had, in the majority
    of cases, been incorrect, whilst it would have been but in very few
    instances they had been fulfilled.</p>

  <p><em>Prediction by the observation of natural phenomena.</em>—The above remarks
    may perhaps help us to understand the prognostications of the ancient
    philosophers about which Professor Antonio Favaro, of Padua, has
    written.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Cicero in the ‘De Divinatione,’ speaking on this subject,
    says that ‘God has not predicted so much
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>as the divine intelligence of
    man.’—‘Non Deus prævidet tantum, sed et divini in genii viri.’ Favaro
    regards these predictions, however, as the result of observations of
    nature which show it is possible that indications of coming earthquakes
    had been announced by variations in the gas given out from subterranean
    sources, the change in colour, taste, level, temperature of the water
    in springs, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In 1843 a bishop of Ischia forewarned his people of a conning
    earthquake, and thus was instrumental in the saving of many lives.
    Naturally, in an age of superstition, the bishop would be regarded as
    a prophet, but Favaro considers that the prognostication was probably
    due to a knowledge of premonitory signs as exhibited in changes in the
    characters of mineral waters.</p>

  <p>The shock of 1851, at Melfi, was in this way predicted by the Capuchin
    fathers, who observed that a lake near their door became frothy and
    turbulent.</p>

  <p>Underground noises have led persons to the belief that an earthquake
    was at hand. It was in this way that Viduari, a prisoner at Lima,
    predicted the destruction of that city.</p>

  <p>Before the earthquake of 1868, so severely felt at Iquique, the
    inhabitants were terrified by loud subterranean noises.</p>

  <p>That underground noises have preceded earthquakes by considerable
    intervals appears to be a fact, but, at the same time, it must
    be remembered that similar noises have often occurred without an
    earthquake having taken place.</p>

  <p>Farmers predicted the earthquake of St. Remo, in 1831, by underground
    noises.</p>

  <p>On the day before the earthquake which, in 1873, shook Mount Baldo,
    the inhabitants of Puos, a village north of Lake Santa Croce, heard
    underground noises.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

  <p>Before the earthquakes which, in 1783, shook Calabria and Sicily, fish
    are said to have appeared in great numbers on the coast of Sicily, and
    the whirlpool of Charybdis assumed an unusual excited state.</p>

  <p>It is said that Pherecydes predicted the earthquakes of Lacedemon and
    Helm out, by the taste of the water in the very deep well at the castle
    of Lovain.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

  <p>The writer of an article on the Lisbon earthquake says that ‘after the
    24th I felt apprehensive, as I observed the same prognostics as on the
    afternoon of October 31, that is, the weather was severe, the wind
    northerly, a fog came from the sea, the water in a fountain ran of a
    yellow clay colour, and’ he adds, ‘from midnight to the morning of the
    25th I felt five shocks.’<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

  <p>At the present time Rudolf Falb, following a theory based upon the
    attractive influences of the sun and moon, tells us the time at which
    we are to expect earthquakes.</p>

  <p>That occasionally there are signs attendant on earthquakes, although
    we cannot give them a physical explanation, we cannot doubt. Also we
    know that in certain areas earthquakes are more likely to occur at
    one season than at another. Should earthquakes be foretold with the
    assistance of knowledge of this description, the predictions at once
    become the result of the application of certain natural laws, and are
    not to be regarded as predictions in the popularly accepted sense of
    that term, any more than the arrival of a friend is predicted by the
    previous receipt of a telegram announcing his coming.</p>

  <p>Rather than accredit the ancients and those of more modern times who,
    in consequence of their feelings, have recorded the coming of an
    earthquake, with a knowledge of premonitory signs, we might in many
    instances regard <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
    the records of those prognostications as the survival
    of accidental guesses, and, as such, examples of the survival of the
    useless.</p>

  <p>The effect of accidental occurrences of this description upon an
    uneducated mind, in engendering superstition, is a subject which has
    often been dwelt upon, and the difficulty of eradicating the same—as
    may be judged of by the following accident which came under the
    observation of Mr. T. B. Lloyd and the author, in 1873, when travelling
    in Newfoundland—will be easily appreciated.</p>

  <p>At the time to which I refer, my companion was bringing a canoe down
    the rapids below the Grand Pond in a country which is practically
    uninhabited, and where an Indian trapper would perhaps be the only
    person met with, and this not more than once a year. Whilst shooting
    the rapids one of the Indians, Reuben Soulian, shot at a deer passing
    up one bank of the river. That the deer had been hit was testified by a
    trail of blood which bespattered the rocks. Subsequently several more
    shots were fired, and it was believed by all that the deer was killed.
    Soulian quickly followed the animal to the spot where it was supposed
    to have fallen. Some time after he returned, having failed to find any
    trace of the animal. He was greatly agitated, but eventually became
    melancholy, saying that the sudden disappearance of the animal was a
    sure sign that some of his relations had suddenly died. About two hours
    afterwards Mr. Lloyd’s party met with a party of Indians coming up
    the river, the first they had seen for four weeks, who told them that
    Soulian’s sister had just died on the coast.</p>

  <p>In the northern part of South America certain shocks are anticipated by
    preliminary vibrations which cause a little bell attached to a T-shaped
    frame (cruz sonante) to ring. There are, however, persons (trembloron)
    who are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
    supposed to be endowed with seismic foresight, whose verdicts
    are much relied upon.</p>

  <p>In Caraccas it is said that nearly every street in the river suburb has
    an earthquake Cassandra or two. Some of these go so far not only as
    to predict the coming seisms, but also the vicissitudes of particular
    streets.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Earthquake prophets are, however, by no means confined to
    the new world, and many examples of them may be found in the histories
    of countries where earthquakes have been felt.</p>

  <p>The story of the crazy lifeguardsman who prophesied an earthquake to
    take place in London on April 4, 1691, is an example. The Rev. Sig.
    Pasquel E. Perdini, writing on the earthquakes at Leghorn in 1742,
    says that ‘a Milanese astrologer predicted this earthquake for January
    27, by which “misfortune” the faith and credit given to the astrologer
    gained him more reverence and honour than the prophets and holy
    gospel.’ Before the time at which he predicted a second shock, people
    removed away from Leghorn.</p>

  <p><em>Warnings furnished by animals.</em>—A study of the warnings furnished by
    animals is also interesting. Several of the natives in Caraccas possess
    oracular quadrupeds, such as dogs, cats, and jerboas, which anticipate
    coming dangers by their restlessness.</p>

  <p>Before the catastrophe of 1812, at Caraccas, a Spanish stallion broke
    out from its stable and escaped to the highlands, which was regarded
    as the result of the prescience of a coming calamity. Before the
    disturbances of 1822 and 1835, which shook Chili, immense flocks of sea
    birds flew inland, as if they had been alarmed by the commencement of
    some suboceanic disturbance. Before this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>last shock it is also related
    that all the dogs escaped from the city of Talcahuano.</p>

  <p><em>Earthquake warning.</em>—What has here been said respecting the prediction
    of earthquakes is necessarily imperfect—many of the signs which are
    popularly supposed to enable persons to foretell the coming of an
    earthquake having already been mentioned in previous chapters. That
    we shall yet be able to prepare ourselves against the coming of
    earthquakes, by the applications of laws governing these disturbances,
    is not an unreasonable hope.</p>

  <p>With an electric circuit which is closed by a movement of the ground,
    we are already in a position to warn the dwellers in surrounding
    districts that a movement is approaching.</p>

  <p>An earthquake which travelled at the rate of four seconds to the
    mile might, if it were allowed to close a circuit which fired a gun
    at a station fifteen miles distant, give the inhabitants at that
    place a minute’s warning to leave their houses. The inhabitants of
    Australia and the western shores of the Pacific might, by telegraphic
    communication, receive eighteen to twenty-five hours’ warning of the
    coming of destructive sea waves resulting from earthquakes in South
    America.</p>

  <p>Although warnings like these might have their value, that which is
    chiefly required is to warn the dwellers at and near an earthquake
    centre of coming disturbances.</p>

  <p>What the results of the observations on earth tremors will lead to is
    problematical.</p>

  <p>Should microseismic observation enable us to say when and where the
    minute movements of the soil will reach a head, a valuable contribution
    to the insurance of human safety in earthquake regions will have been
    attained.</p>

  <p>As to whether the movements of tromometers are destined to become
    barometric-like warnings of increased
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> activity beneath the earth
    crust, or whether they are only due to vibrations of the earth
    crust produced by variations in atmospheric pressure, has yet to be
    investigated.</p>

  <p>Other phenomena which may probably forewarn us of the coming of an
    earthquake are phenomena resultant on the stresses brought to bear upon
    the rocky crust previous to its fracture, or phenomena due to changes
    in the position and condition of heated materials beneath the earth’s
    surface. Amongst these may be mentioned electrical disturbances, which
    appear to be so closely related to seismic phenomena.</p>

  <p>At the time of earthquakes telegraph lines have been disturbed, but
    as to what may happen before an earthquake we have as yet but little
    information. The subject of earthquake warning is of importance to many
    countries, and is deserving of attention.</p>

  <p>As our knowledge of earth movements, and their attendant phenomena,
    increases, there is but little doubt that laws will gradually be
    formulated, and in the future, as telluric disturbances increase, a
    large black ball gradually ascending a staff may warn the inhabitants
    on the land of a coming earthquake, with as much certainty as the ball
    upon a pole at many seaports warns the mariner of coming storms.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span> the past few years considerable attention has been drawn towards
    the study of small vibratory motions of the ground, which to the
    unaided senses are usually passed by without recognition. These motions
    are called <em>earth tremors</em>. Their discovery appears to have been due
    to accident, and not to the results of inductive reasoning. No sooner
    had philosophers contrived astronomical and other instruments for the
    purpose of making refined measurements and observations than they at
    once discovered that they had an enemy to contend against in the form
    of microscopic earthquakes.</p>

  <p><em>Artificially produced tremors.</em>—Artificial disturbances of this
    description exist in all our towns, and near a railway line they are
    perceptible with every passing train. Those who have used microscopes
    of high power will readily appreciate how small a disturbance of
    the ground is visible in the apparent movement of the object under
    examination.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

  <p>Captain Kater found that he could not perform his pendulum experiments
    in London on account of the vibrations produced by the rolling of
    carriages. Captain Denman, who made some observations on artificially
    produced tremors, found that a goods train produced an effect 1,100
    feet distant in marshy ground over sandstone. Vertically, however,
    above a tunnel through the sandstone, the effects only extended 100
    feet.</p>

  <p>A remarkable example of the trouble which artificially produced earth
    vibrations have occasioned those who make astronomical observations
    occurred some twenty years ago at the Greenwich Observatory. When
    determining the collimation error of the transit circle by means of the
    reflexion of a star in a tray of mercury, it was found that on certain
    nights the surface of the mercury was in such a state of trembling
    that the observers were unable to complete their observations until
    long after midnight. After obtaining a series of dates on which these
    disturbances occurred, it was found that they coincided with public and
    bank holidays, on which days crowds of the poorer classes of London
    flocked to Greenwich Park, and there amused themselves with running and
    rolling down the hill on which the observatory is situated. On these
    occasions it was found that the disturbances in the mercury were such
    that observations could not be made until two or three hours after the
    crowds had been turned out of the neighbouring park.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

  <p>To obviate this difficulty Sir George Airy suspended his dish of
    mercury in a system of india-rubber bands, and in this way succeeded in
    eating the intruders up.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-Colonel H. S. Palmer, R.E., when engaged with the transit
    of Venus expedition in New Zealand, in 1874, was troubled with
    vibrations produced from a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
    neighbouring railway. To escape the enemy
    he intrenched his instruments by placing them in pits. With pits
    3½ feet deep he found himself sufficiently protected. The distance
    from the line was about 400 yards, and the soil through which the
    disturbances were propagated was a coarse pebbly gravel.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

  <p>Before the United States Naval Observatory was established at
    Washington, Professor H. M. Paul was deputed to make a tremor survey
    to discover stable ground. The results of these experiments were
    exceedingly interesting. By watching the reflected image of a star in
    a dish of mercury a passing train would be noticed at the distance of
    a mile. Its approach could be detected by the trembling of the image
    before its coming could be heard. At one point of observation the
    disturbance appeared to be cut off by a ravine. The strata was gravel
    and clay.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

  <p>These few examples of artificially produced tremors, to which many
    more might be added, have been given because they teach us something
    respecting their nature. Hitherto earth tremors have only been regarded
    as intruders, which it was necessary to escape from or destroy. From
    what has been said they appear to be a superficial disturbance which
    is propagated to an enormous distance. This distance appears to
    depend upon the propagating medium, upon the intensity of the initial
    disturbance, and upon its duration. In the observation of these
    artificial disturbances, which are accessible to every one, and which
    hitherto have been so neglected, we have undoubtedly a fruitful source
    of study.</p>

  <p><em>Natural tremors.</em>—Next let us turn to those microscopical disturbances
    of our soil which are due to natural
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>causes. Thus far they seem to
    have been recorded wherever instruments suitable for their detection
    have been erected, and it is not improbable that they are common to the
    surface of the whole globe.</p>

  <p>Some of the more definite observations which have been made upon earth
    tremors were those made in connection with experiments on the deviation
    of the vertical due to the attractive influence of the moon and sun.</p>

  <p>Professor Zöllner, who invented the horizontal pendulum which he used
    in the attempt to measure the change in level due to lunar and solar
    attraction, found his instruments so sensitive that the readings were
    always changing.</p>

  <p>The most interesting observations which were made upon small
    disturbances of the soil were those of M. d’Abbadie, who carried on his
    experiments at Abbadia, in Subernoa, near Hendaye, 400 mètres distant
    from the Atlantic, and 62 mètres above sea level. The soil was a loamy
    rock. Here M. d’Abbadie constructed a concrete cone 8 mètres in height,
    which was pierced down the centre by a vertical hole or well, which was
    continued two mètres below the cone into the solid rock. At the bottom
    of this hole or well a pool of mercury was formed which reflected
    the image of cross wires placed at the top of the hole. These cross
    wires and their reflection were observed by means of a microscope.
    The observations consisted in noting the displacement and azimuth of
    the reflected image relatively to the real image of the wires. After
    allowing this structure five years to settle, M. d’Abbadie commenced
    his observations. To find the surface of the mercury tranquil was
    a rare occurrence. Sometimes the mercury appeared to be in violent
    motion, although both the air and neighbouring sea were perfectly calm.
    At times the reflected image would disappear as if the mercury had been
    disturbed by a microscopic earthquake.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

  <p>The relative positions of the images were in part governed by the state
    of the tide. Altogether the movements were so strange that M. d’Abbadie
    did not venture any speculations as to their cause, but he remarks
    that the cause of the changes he observed were sometimes neither
    astronomical nor thermometrical. These observations, the principal
    object of which was to determine changes in level rather than earth
    vibrations, were carried on between the years 1868 and 1872.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

  <p><em>Observations at Cambridge.</em>—Another instructive set of observations
    were those which were made in the years 1880–1882, by George and Horace
    Darwin, in the Cavendish Laboratory, at Cambridge. The main object
    in these experiments was to determine the disturbing influence of
    gravity produced by lunar attraction. The result which was obtained,
    however, showed that the soil at Cambridge was in such an incessant
    state of vibration that whatever pull the moon may have exerted upon
    the instrument which was employed was masked by the magnitude of the
    effects produced by the earth tremors, and the experiments had, in
    consequence, to be abandoned.</p>

  <p>The principle of this instrument was similar to one devised by Sir
    William Thomson, and put up by him in his laboratory at Glasgow.
    As erected by the brothers Darwin, at Cambridge, it was briefly as
    follows: A pendulum, which was a massive cylinder of pure copper,
    was hung by a copper wire, about four feet long, inside a hollow
    cylindrical tube rising from a stone support. A small mirror was then
    hung by two silk fibres, one of which was fastened to the bob and the
    other to the stone basement. A ray of light sent from a lamp on to
    the mirror was reflected to a scale seven feet distant, and by this
    magnification any motion of the bob relatively to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>the stone support
    was magnified 50,000 times. In several ways the apparatus was insulated
    from all accidental disturbances. The spot of light was observed from
    another room by means of a telescope. This instrument was so delicate
    that even at the distance of sixteen feet the shifting of your weight
    from one foot to the other caused the spot of light to run along the
    scale. So sensitive was the instrument that, notwithstanding its being
    cut off from the surrounding soil by a trench filled with water and
    the whole instrument being immersed in water to damp out the small
    vibrations, it would seem that the ground was in a constant state of
    tremor; in fact, so persistent and irregular were these movements that
    it seemed impossible to separate them from the perturbations due to the
    attraction of the moon.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

  <p>As a result of observations like these, the world had gradually
    forced upon it the fact that the ground on which we live is probably
    everywhere in what is practically an incessant state of vibration.</p>

  <p>This led those who were interested in the study of earth movements to
    establish special apparatus for the purpose of recording these motions
    with the hope of eventually discovering the laws by which they were
    governed.</p>

  <p><em>Experiments in Japan.</em>—The simpler forms of apparatus which have been
    used in Japan may be described as delicate forms of seismoscopes,
    which, in addition to recording earth tremors, also record the
    occurrence of small earthquakes.</p>

  <p>A simple contrivance which may be used for the purpose of recording
    small earthquakes can be made with a small compass needle.</p>

  <p>If a light, small sensitive compass needle be placed on
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>a table, it
    will be found that a small piece of iron like a nail may be pushed so
    near to it that the needle assumes a position of extremely unstable
    equilibrium. If the table now receives the slightest tap or shake this
    condition is overcome, and the needle flies to the iron and there
    remains. By making the support of the needle and the iron the poles of
    an electric circuit it is possible to register the time at which motion
    took place with considerable accuracy.</p>

  <p>With crude apparatus like this a large number of small earth
    disturbances have been recorded.</p>

  <p>Another form of apparatus, employed in Japan, has been a delicately
    constructed <em>circuit closer</em>. The motions of this instrument were
    recorded by causing an electro-magnet to deflect a pencil which was
    tracing a circle on a revolving dial. The revolving dial was a disc of
    wood covered with paper fixed to the hour-hand axle of a common clock.</p>

  <p>A third form of apparatus used in Japan consisted of a small piece of
    sheet lead about the size of a threepenny piece suspended by a short
    loop from a rigid support. Projecting from the lead a fine wire, about
    two inches in length, passed freely through a hole in a metallic plate.
    By the slightest motion of the support the small pendulum of lead was
    set into a state of tremor and caused its pointer to come in contact
    with one or other side of the hole in the metal plate and thus to close
    an electric circuit.</p>

  <p>A more refined kind of apparatus which has been employed in Japan was
    similar to that used by the Darwins at Cambridge. This was so arranged
    that any deflection of the mirror was permanent until the instrument
    was reset, and in this way the maximum disturbance which had taken
    place between each observation was recorded.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

  <p>In addition to these and other contrivances, experiments were made with
    microphones.</p>

  <p>The microphones used were small doubly pointed pencils of carbon
    about three centimetres long, saturated with mercury, and supported
    vertically in pivot holes bored in other pieces of carbon, which were
    the terminals of an electric circuit. These microphones were screwed
    down on the top of stakes driven deeply into the ground. They were
    covered with a glass shade thickly greased at its base. The stakes were
    in the ground at the bottom of a small pit—about two feet square and
    two feet deep—which was lined with a box. The box was covered with a
    lid, and earth to the depth of nine inches or one foot. One of these
    pits was in the middle of a lawn in the front of my house, and the
    other was at the foot of a hill at the back of the house. The wires
    from the microphone passed through the side of the box into a bamboo
    tube and thence up to my dining-room and bed-room. In one of the
    circuits there were three Daniell’s cells, a telephone, and a small
    galvanometer. I used the galvanometer because I found that when there
    was sufficient motion in the microphone to produce a sound in the
    telephone a motion in the needle of a galvanometer was produced. If in
    any case motion took place in the magnetic needle during my absence, it
    was held deflected by a small piece of iron with which it was brought
    into contact by the movement.</p>

  <p>The sensitiveness of the arrangement may be judged of from the fact
    that if a person walked on the grass within six feet of the microphone,
    each step caused a creak in the telephone, and the needle of the
    galvanometer was caused to swing and come in contact with the iron.
    Dogs running on the grass had no effect. A small stone one or two
    inches in diameter thrown from the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> house so that it fell near to the
    microphone pit caused a sharp creak in the telephone and a movement in
    the needle.</p>

  <p>The nature of the records I received from this contrivance may be
    judged of from the following extract from my papers.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Here I went out, took away the covering, and examined the microphone.
    Nothing wrong was to be observed. All that I saw was one small ant. I
    do not think that this could have caused the disturbance, because it
    could not get near the instrument.</p>

  <p>On the succeeding nights I experienced similar disturbances, and it
    seemed as if they might possibly have been the prelude to several small
    shocks which occurred about this time (November 15, 16, and 17). On
    November 17, at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, the needle was found in contact, and
    again at 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and at 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the shock of a small
    earthquake was felt <em>which caused a rattling sound in the telephone for
      about one minute after the motion had appeared to cease</em>. The needle
    swung considerably, but did not come in contact.</p>

  <p>The great objection to these observations is that it is possible
    that the movements and sounds which I have recorded might, with the
    exception of one case when the shaking was actually felt, possibly have
    been produced by causes other than that of the movement of the ground.
    To determine this I subsequently put up two distinct sets
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> of apparatus
    to determine whether the motions of each were synchronous. So far as
    I went this appeared only to be sometimes the case:—but this is a
    question difficult to determine, unless a recorder of time be added to
    the apparatus.</p>

  <p>The greatest objection to observations of this sort is that the
    sensibility of the instrument is not constant. After a current has been
    running for several days it is no longer sensible to slight shocks, it
    appears as if its resistance had been increased. To overcome this it is
    necessary to resharpen the carbon points and bore out the pivot holes
    every three or four days. Farther, the battery varies. This might to
    some extent be overcome by using a battery with large plates. These
    two causes tend to reduce the sensitiveness of the galvanometer-like
    recorder—the deflection of the needle gradually becoming less and less,
    and therefore day by day needing a greater swing to bring it into
    contact with the iron. For reasons such as these this instrument, to be
    used successfully, appears to require considerable attention.</p>

  <p>Another form of microphone employed by the author consisted of an
    aluminium wire standing vertically on a metallic plate, its upper end
    passing loosely through a hole in an aluminium wire standard.</p>

  <p>The upper end of the vertical wire was loaded with lead. This
    contrivance possesses all the sensitiveness of an ordinary microphone,
    whilst, if it receives a sudden impulse, there is a sudden break in the
    current, and the vertical wire is thrown from one side to the other of
    the hole in the standard.</p>

  <p>After many months of tiresome observation with instruments of this
    description, and after eliminating all motions which might have been
    produced by accidental causes, the general result obtained showed that
    in Tokio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
    there were movements of the soil to be detected every day,
    and sometimes many times per day, which to ordinary persons were passed
    by unnoticed.</p>

  <p><em>Work in Italy.</em>—The most satisfactory observations which have been
    made upon microseismic disturbances are those which have been made
    during the last ten years in Italy. The father of systematical
    microseismical research appears to have been Father Timoteo Bertelli,
    of Florence.</p>

  <p>In 1870 Father Bertelli suspended a pendulum in a cellar, and observed
    it with a microscope. As the result of his observations it was
    announced that he had perceived the earthquakes which shook Romagna,
    although to the ordinary observer in Florence these shakings had not
    been perceptible.</p>

  <p>In 1873 Bertelli, by means of microscopes fixed in several azimuths,
    made 5,500 observations on free pendulums. He also made observations on
    reflections from the surface of mercury.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

  <p>One result of these observations was to show that microseismic motions
    increased with a fall of the barometer. Similar observations were made
    at Bologna by M. le Conte Malvasia, and also by M. S. di Rossi, near
    Rome. On January 14, 15, and February 25 these three observers at their
    respective stations simultaneously observed great disturbances.</p>

  <p>Similar investigations were made at Nice by M. le Baron Prost.</p>

  <p>Although doubt was cast upon Bertelli’s observations they appear to
    have been the origin of a series of microseismical observations, a
    distinguished leader in which is Professor Rossi, who, in 1874, found
    that large earthquakes were almost always preceded or accompanied with
    microseismical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
    storms. In 1878 Professor Rossi worked upon these small
    disturbances with the assistance of the microphone and telephone, and
    his first results were published by Professor Palmieri.</p>

  <p>Many of Professor Rossi’s observations were made in the grotto of Roca
    de Papa, 700 mètres high and eighteen mètres under the soil. Here over
    6,000 observations were made by means of microscopes, on pendulums of
    different lengths, suspended in tubes cut in the solid rock.</p>

  <p><em>Instruments employed in Italy.</em>—It is impossible to describe in detail
    the various forms of apparatus which have been used by the Italian
    investigators. A description of one or two of the more important
    instruments may not, however, be out of place, inasmuch as they will
    assist the reader to understand the manner in which the various results
    respecting the laws governing microseismic movements have been arrived
    at.</p>

  <p>The most important of these instruments is the <em>Normal Tromometer</em> of
    Bertelli and Rossi.</p>

  <p>This consists of a pendulum 1½ metres long, carrying, by means of
    a very fine wire, a weight of 100 grammes. To the base of the bob
    a vertical stile is attached, and the whole is enclosed in a tube
    terminated, at its base, by a glass prism of such a form that when
    looked through horizontally the motion of the stile can be seen in
    all azimuths. In front of this prism a microscope is placed. Inside
    the microscope there is a micromatic scale, so arranged that it can
    be turned to coincide with the apparent direction of oscillation of
    the point of the stile. In this way not only can the amplitude of the
    motion of the stile be measured, but also its azimuth. The extent of
    vertical motion is measured by the up and down motion of the stile due
    to the elasticity of the supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
    wire. This instrument is shown in the accompanying drawing.</p>

      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Another apparatus is the <em>Microseismograph</em> of Professor Rossi. Here we
    have an arrangement which gives automatic records of slight motions.
    It consists of four pendulums, each about three feet long, suspended
    so that they form the corners of a square platform. In the centre
    of this platform a fifth, but rather longer, pendulum is suspended.
    The four pendulums are each connected just above their bobs to the
    central pendulum with loose silk threads. Fixed to the centre of each
    of these threads, and held vertically by a light spring, is a needle,
    so adjusted that each thread is depressed to form an obtuse angle of
    about 155°. These needles form the terminals of an electric circuit,
    the other termination of which is a small cup of mercury placed just
    below the lower end of the needle. By a horizontal swing of one of the
    pendulums this arrangement causes the needle to move vertically, but
    with a slightly multiplied amplitude. By this motion the needle comes
    in contact with the mercury, and an electro-magnet with a lever and
    pencil is caused to make a mark on a band of paper moved by clockwork.
    The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
    five pendulums being of different lengths allows the apparatus to
    respond ‘to seismic waves of different
    velocities.’<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

  <p>Lastly, we have Professor Rossi’s <em>Microphone</em>. This consists of a
    metallic swing arranged like the beam of a balance. By means of a
    movable weight at one end of the beam this is so adjusted that it
    falls down until it comes in contact with a metallic stop. This can be
    so adjusted that a slight tap will cause the beam to slightly jump from
    the stop. The beam and the stop form two poles of an electric circuit,
    in which there is a telephone. The slightest motion in a <em>vertical</em>
    direction causes a fluctuation in the current passing between the stop
    and the beam, and a consequent noise is heard in the telephone.</p>

  <p>With instruments analogous to these, observations have been made by
    various observers in all portions of Italy, extending over a period
    of ten years. Every precaution appears to have been taken to avoid
    accidental disturbances, and the experiments have been repeated in a
    variety of forms.</p>

  <p><em>Results obtained in Italy.</em>—The results which from time to time have
    been announced are of the greatest interest to those who study the
    physics of the earth’s crust, and they appear to be leading to the
    establishment of laws of scientific value.</p>

  <p>It would seem that the soil of Italy is in incessant movement, there
    being periods of excessive activity usually lasting about ten days.
    Such periods are called seismic storms. These storms are separated by
    periods of relative calm. These storms have their greater regularity
    in winter, and sharp maximums are to be observed in spring and autumn.
    In the midst of such a period or
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>at its end there is usually an
    earthquake. Usually these storms are closely related to barometric
    depressions. To distinguish these movements from those which occur
    under high pressure, the latter are called baro seismic movements, and
    the former <em>vulcano seismic</em> movements. The relation of these storms
    to barometric fluctuation has been observed to have been very marked
    during the time of a volcanic eruption.</p>

  <p>At the commencement of a storm the motions are usually small, and one
    storm, lasting two or three days, may be joined to another storm.
    In such a case the action may be a local one. It has been observed
    that a barometrical depression tended to bring a storm to a maximum,
    whilst an increase of pressure would cause it to disappear. Sometimes
    these actions are purely local, but at other times they may affect a
    considerable tract of land.</p>

  <p>If a number of pendulums of different length are observed at the same
    place, there is a general similarity in their movements, but it is also
    evident that the free period of the pendulum more or less disturbs
    the character of the record. The greatest amplitude of motion in a
    set of pendulums is not reached simultaneously by all the pendulums,
    and at every disturbance the movement of one will predominate. From
    this Rossi argues that the character of the microseismical motions is
    not constant. Bertelli observed that the direction of oscillation of
    the pendulums is different at different places, but each place will
    have its particular direction dependent upon the direction of valleys
    and chains of mountains in the neighbourhood. Rossi shows that the
    directions of movement are perpendicular to the direction of lines of
    faults, the lips of these fractures rising and falling, and producing
    two sets of waves, one set parallel to the line of fracture,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span> and the
    other perpendicular to such a direction. These movements, according
    to Bertelli, have no connection with the wind, rain, change of
    temperature, and atmospheric electricity.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p321.jpg" width="542" height="444" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The disturbances, as recorded at different towns, are not always
    strictly synchronous, but succeed each other at short intervals. If,
    however, we take monthly curves of the disturbances as recorded at
    different towns in Italy, we see that these are similar in character.
    The maximum of disturbance occurs about the winter solstice, and the
    minimum about the summer solstice, and in this respect they exhibit
    a perfect accordance with the curves drawn by Mallet to show the
    periodicity of earthquakes. The accompanying curves taken from one
    of Bertelli’s original memoirs not only show this general result but
    also show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
    the close accord there is between the results obtained at
    different towns during successive months.</p>

  <p>At Florence, before a period of earthquakes there is an increase in the
    amplitude and frequency of vertical movements. These vertical movements
    do not appear to coincide with the barometrical disturbances, but they
    appear to be connected with the seismic disturbances.</p>

  <p>They are usually accompanied with noises in the telephone, but as the
    microphone is so constructed as to be more sensitive to vertical motion
    than to horizontal motion, this is to be expected. This vertical motion
    would appear to be a local action, inasmuch as the accompanying motions
    of an earthquake which originates at a distance are horizontal.</p>

  <p>Storms of microseismical motions appear to travel from point to point.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a local earthquake is not noticed in the tromometer,
    whilst one which occurred at a distance, although it may be small,
    is distinctly observed. To explain this, Bertelli suggests the
    existence of nodes. Similar conclusions were arrived at by Rossi when
    experimenting on different portions of the sides of Vesuvius. Galli
    noticed an augmentation in microseismic activity when the sun and moon
    are near the meridian. Grablovitz found from Bertelli’s observations
    a maximum two or three days before the syzygies, and a minimum
    three days after these periods. He also found that the principal
    large disturbances occurred in the middle of periods separating
    the quadrature from the syzygies, the apogee from perigee, and the
    lunistigi period from the nodes, whilst the smallest disturbances
    happened in the middle of periods opposed to these.</p>

  <p>P. C. Melzi says that the curves of microseismical motions,
    earthquakes, lunar and solar motions, show a concordance with each
    other.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

  <p>With the microphone Rossi hears sounds which he describes as roarings,
    explosions, occurring isolated or in volleys, metallic and bell-like
    sounds, ticking, &amp;c., which, he says, revealed natural telluric
    phenomena. Sometimes these have been intolerably loud. At Vesuvius the
    vertical shocks corresponded with a sound like volleys of musketry,
    whilst the undulatory shocks gave the roaring. Some of these sounds
    could be imitated artificially by rubbing together the conducting wires
    in the same manner in which the rocks must rub against each other in
    an earthquake. Other sounds were imitated by placing the microphone
    on a vessel of boiling water, or by putting it on a marble slab and
    scratching and tapping the under side of it.</p>

  <p>These, then, are some of the more important results which have been
    arrived at by the study of microseismic motions. One point which seems
    worthy of attention is that they appear to be more law-abiding than
    their more violent relations, the earthquakes, and as phenomena in
    which natural laws are to be traced they are certainly deserving our
    attention. As to whether they will ever become the means of forewarning
    ourselves against earthquakes is yet problematical. Their systematic
    study, however, will enable us to trace the progress of a microseismic
    storm from point to point, and it is not impossible that we may yet
    be enabled to foretell where the storm may reach its climax as an
    earthquake. These, I believe, are the views of Professor di Rossi, who
    is at the present time engaged in the establishment of a system of
    microseismic observations throughout Italy.</p>

  <p>Before the earthquake of San Remo (Dec. 6, 1874) Rossi’s tromometer
    was in a state of agitation, and similar disturbances were observed at
    Livorno, Florence, and Bologna.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

  <p>Since February 1883 I have observed a tromometer in Japan, and such
    results as have been obtained accord with results obtained in Italy.
    The increase in microseismical activity with a fall of the barometer
    is very marked. Other peculiarities in the behaviour of the instrument
    will be referred to under ‘Earth Pulsations.’</p>

  <p><em>Cause of microseismic movements.</em>—As to the cause of tromometric
    movements, we have a field for speculation. Possibly they may be
    due to slight vibratory motions produced in the soil by the bending
    and crackling of rocks produced by their rise upon the relief of
    atmospheric pressure. If this were so we should expect similar
    movements to be produced at the time of an increase of pressure. Rossi
    suggests that they may be the result of an increased escape of vapour
    from the molten materials beneath the crust of the earth, consequent
    upon a relief of pressure. The similarity of some of the sounds which
    are heard with the microphone to those produced by boiling water are
    suggestive of this, and Rossi quotes instances when underground noises
    like those which we should expect to hear from a boiling fluid have
    been heard before earthquakes without the aid of microphones. One
    instance was that of Viduari, a prisoner in Lima, who, two days before
    the shock of 1824, repeatedly predicted the same in consequence of the
    noises he heard.</p>

  <p>A possible cause of disturbances of this order may be small but
    sudden fluctuations in barometric pressure, which are visible during
    a storm. During a small typhoon on September 15, 1881, when in the
    Kurile Islands, I observed that the needle of an aneroid worked back
    and forth with a period of from one to three seconds. This continued
    for several hours. With every gust of wind the needle suddenly rose
    and then immediately fell. At times it trembled. These movements were
    observed in the open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
    air. The extent of these sudden variations
    was approximately from ·03 to ·05 inches. Beckoning an increase of
    barometrical pressure of one hundredth of an inch as equivalent to a
    load of twenty million pounds on the square mile, during this storm
    there must have been the equivalent of loads of from 60 to 100 million
    pounds to the square mile continually placed on and removed from a
    considerable tract of the earth’s surface. If the period of application
    of these stresses approximately coincide with the natural vibrational
    period of the area affected, it would surely seem, especially when
    we reflect upon the effect of an ordinary carriage, that tremors of
    considerable magnitude ought to be produced.</p>

  <p>An inspection of the following few observations taken from my note-book
    for the same typhoon will suggest that even the large and slower
    variations are capable of producing tremulous motions.</p>

  <div class="summary">
    Definition of an earth pulsation—Indications of
    pendulums—Indications of levels—Other phenomena indicating
    the existence of earth pulsations—Disturbances in lakes and
    oceans—Phenomena resultant on earth pulsations—Cause of earth
    pulsations.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> object of the present chapter is to show that from time to time it
    is very probable that slow but large wave-like undulations travel over
    or disturb the surface of the globe.</p>

  <p>These movements, which have escaped our attention on account of their
    slowness in period, for want of another term I call earth pulsations.</p>

  <p>The existence of movements such as these may be indicated to us by
    changes in the level of bodies of water like seas and lakes, by the
    movements of delicate levels, by the displacement of the bob of a
    pendulum relatively to some point on the earth above which it hangs,
    and by other phenomena which will be enumerated.</p>

  <p><em>Indication of pendulums.</em>—Pendulums which have been suspended for the
    purposes of seismometrical observations have, both by observers in
    Italy and Japan, been seen to have moved a short distance out from, and
    then back to, their normal position.</p>

  <p>This motion has simply taken place on one side of their central
    position, and is not due to a swing. The
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span> character of these records
    is such that we might imagine the soil on which the support of the
    pendulum had rested to have been slowly tilted, and slowly lowered.
    They are the most marked on those pendulums provided with an index
    writing a record of its motions on a smoked glass plate, which index is
    so arranged that it gives a multiplied representation of the relative
    motion between it and the earth. As motions of this sort might be
    possibly due to the action of moisture in the soil tilting the support
    of the pendulum, and to a variety of other accidental causes, we cannot
    insist on them as being certain indications that there are slow tips in
    the soil, but for the present allow them to remain as possible proof of
    such phenomena.</p>

  <p>Evidence of displacement of the vertical, which are more definite than
    the above, are those made by Bertelli, Rossi, Count Malvasia, and other
    Italian observers, who, whilst recording earth tremors, have spent so
    much time in watching the vibrations of stiles of delicate pendulums
    by means of microscopes. As a result of these observations we are
    told that the point about which the stile of a pendulum oscillates
    is variable. These displacements take place in various azimuths, and
    they appear to be connected with changes of the barometer. I have made
    similar observations in Japan.</p>

  <p>From this, and from the fact that it is found that a number of
    different pendulums differently situated on the same area give similar
    evidence of these movements, it would hardly seem that these phenomena
    could be attributed to causes like changes in temperature and moisture.
    M. S. di Rossi lays stress on this point, especially in connection with
    his microseismograph, where there are a number of pendulums of unequal
    length which give indications of a like character. The direction in
    which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
    these tips of the soil take place—which phenomena are noticeable
    in seismic as well as microseismic motions—Rossi states are related to
    the direction of certain lines of faulting.</p>

  <p><em>Indications of levels.</em>—Bubbles of delicate levels can be easily seen
    to change their position with meteorological variations; but Rossi also
    tells us that they change their position, sometimes not to return for
    a long time, during a microseismic storm. Here again we have another
    phenomenon pointing to the fact that microseismic disturbances are the
    companions of slow alterations in level.</p>

  <p>One of the most patient observers of levels has been M. Plantamour,
    who commenced his observations in 1878, at Sécheron, on the Lake of
    Geneva. He used two levels, one placed north and south, and the other
    east and west. During the summer of 1878 the east end rose, but at the
    end of September a depression set in. The diurnal movements had their
    maximum and minimum at 6 and 7.45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The
    total amplitude was 4·89″. The variations of the east and west level
    appeared to be due to the temperature, but the movements of the north
    and south level were dependent upon an unknown cause.</p>

  <p>Between October 1, 1879, and September 30, 1880, the east end fell
    rapidly, from the middle of November up to December 26, amounting to
    88·71″. It then rose 6·55″ to January 5, and then fell again. On
    January 28 it reached 89·95″, after which it rose.</p>

  <p>Between October 4, 1879, and January 28, 1880, the movement was 95·8″,
    against 28·08″ of the previous year.</p>

  <p>These movements were not due alone to temperature. The north and south
    level, which was not influenced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
    the cold of the winter, moved
    4·56″. In the previous year 4·89″.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

  <p>From February 17 to June 5, 1883, the author observed in Tokio the
    bubbles of two delicate levels, one placed north and south, and the
    other east and west. They were placed under glass cases on the head of
    a stone column. The column, which is inside a brick building, rests
    on a concrete foundation, and is about ten years old. It is in no way
    connected with the building. The temperature of the room has a daily
    variation of about 1° Fahr.</p>

  <p>In both these levels diurnal changes are very marked. Occasionally they
    are enormously great. Thus, on March 25, the readings of the south end
    of the north south level were as follows:—</p>

  <p>Usually this level moves through about three divisions per day.</p>

  <p>From March 25 to May 4 it travelled from 98 to 127. Since then, to June
    5, it has descended to 116. During this period the east west level
    has been <em>comparatively</em> quiet. One division of the north south level
    equals about 2″ of arc.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

  <p>Many of these changes may be due to changes in temperature, variations
    in moisture, and other local actions. Some of them, however, are hardly
    explicable on such assumptions. The fact that the general direction in
    change of the vertical, as indicated by a tromometer standing on the
    same column with the levels, showed that the change which was taking
    place was rather in the column than in the instruments.</p>

  <p>The fact also that at the time of a barometrical depression a
    <em>pulse-like surge</em> can be seen in the levels, having a period averaging
    about three seconds and sometimes amounting to about one second of
    arc, is a phenomenon hardly to be attributed to sudden fluctuations in
    moisture or temperature, but indicates real changes in level.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

  <p>In addition to variation in the bubbles of levels which come on more or
    less gradually, we have many recorded instances of <em>sudden</em> alterations
    taking place in these instruments.</p>

  <p>Examples of what may have been a slow oscillating motion of the earth’s
    crust are referred to by Mr. George Darwin in a Report to the British
    Association in 1882.</p>

  <p>One of them was made by M. Magnus Nyrén, at Pulkova, who, when engaged
    in levelling the axis of a telescope, observed spontaneous oscillation
    in the bulb of the level.</p>

  <p>This was on May 10 (April 28), 1877. The complete period was about
    20 seconds, the amplitude being 1·5″ and 2″. One hour and fourteen
    minutes before this he observes that there had been a severe earthquake
    at Iquique, the distance to which in a straight line was 10,600
    kilomètres, and on an arc of a great circle, 12,500 kilomètres.
    On September 20 (8), in 1867, Mr. Wagner
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>had observed at Pulkova
    oscillations of 3″, seven minutes before which there had been an
    earthquake at Malta. On April 4 (March 23), 1868, an agitation of the
    level had been observed by Mr. Gromadzki, five minutes before which
    there had been an earthquake in Turkestan. Similar observations had
    been made twice before. These, however, had not been connected with any
    earthquakes—at least, Mr. Darwin remarks—with certainty.</p>

  <p><em>Phenomena analogous to the pendulum and level observations.</em>—As
    examples of phenomena which are analogous to those made on pendulums
    and levels, the following may be noticed. On March 20, 1881, at 9
    <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> a watchmaker in Buenos Ayres observed that all his
    clocks oscillating north and south suddenly began to increase their
    amplitude, until some of them became twice as great as before. Similar
    observations were made in all the other shops. No motion of the earth
    was detected. Subsequently it was learnt that this corresponded with an
    earthquake in Santiago and Mendoza.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

  <p>Another remarkable example illustrating the like phenomena is furnished
    by the observations which were made on December 21, 1860, by means of a
    barometer in San Francisco, which oscillated, with periods of rest, for
    half an hour. No shock was felt, nor is it likely that it was a local
    accident, as it could not be produced artificially. On the following
    day, however, a violent earthquake was experienced at Santiago.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

  <p>At the time or shortly after the great Lisbon earthquake, curious
    phenomena were observed in distant countries, which only appear to be
    explicable on the assumption of the existence of earth pulsations.</p>

  <p>Thus at Amsterdam and other towns, chandeliers in churches were
    observed to swing. At Haarlem water was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>thrown over the sides of tubs,
    and it is expressly mentioned that no motion was perceived in the
    ground.</p>

  <p>At the Hague a tallow chandler was surprised at the clashing noise
    made by his candles, and this the more so because no motion was felt
    underfoot.</p>

  <p><em>Unusual disturbances in bodies of water.</em>—At the time of large
    earthquakes it would appear that earth pulsations are produced, which
    exhibit themselves in countries where the actual shaking of the
    earthquake is not felt, by disturbances in bodies of waters like lakes
    and seas.</p>

  <p>Some remarkable examples of these disturbances are to be found in the
    records of the great Lisbon earthquake. This earthquake, as a violent
    movement of the ground, was chiefly felt in Spain, Portugal, northern
    Italy, the south of France and Germany, northern Africa, Madeira, and
    other Atlantic islands. In other countries further distant, as, for
    instance, Great Britain, Holland, Scandinavia, and North America,
    although the records are numerous, the only phenomena which were
    particularly observed was the slow oscillations of the waters in lakes,
    ponds, canals, &amp;c. In some instances the observers especially remark
    that there was no motion in the soil.</p>

  <p>Pebley Dam, in Derbyshire, which is a large body of water covering
    some thirty acres, commenced to oscillate from the south. A canal near
    Godalming flowed eight feet over the walk on the north side.</p>

  <p>Coniston Water, in Cumberland, which is about five miles long,
    oscillated for about five minutes, rising a yard up its shores. Near
    Durham a pond, forty yards long and ten broad, rose and fell about one
    foot for six or seven minutes. There were four or five ebbs and flows
    per minute.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

  <p>Loch Lomond rose and fell through about two and a half feet every
    five minutes, and all the other lochs in Scotland seem to have been
    similarly agitated.</p>

  <p>At Shirbrun Castle, in Oxfordshire, where the water in some moats and
    ponds was very carefully observed, it was noticed that the floods
    began gently, the velocity then increased, till at last with great
    impetuosity they reached their full height. Here the water remained for
    a little while, until the ebb commenced, at first gently, but finally
    with great rapidity. At two extremities of a moat about 100 yards long,
    it was found that the sinkings and risings were almost simultaneous.
    The motions in a pond a short distance from the moat were also
    observed, and it was found that the risings and sinkings of the two did
    not agree.</p>

  <p>During these motions there were several maxima.</p>

  <p>These few examples of the motions of waters, without any record of the
    motions of the ground, at the time of the Lisbon earthquake, must be
    taken as examples of a very large number of similar observations of
    which we have detailed accounts.</p>

  <p>Like agitations, it must also be remembered, were perceived in North
    America and in Scandinavia, and if the lakes of other distant countries
    had been provided with sufficiently delicate apparatus, it is not
    unlikely that similar disturbances would have been recorded.</p>

  <p>Besides these movements in the waters of seas and lakes, at or about
    the time of great earthquakes, we have records of like movements, which
    take place as independent phenomena.</p>

  <p>Thus we read that on October 22, 1755, the waters of Lake Ontario rose
    and fell five and a half feet several times in the course of half an
    hour.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> On March 31, 1761,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>Loch Ness rose suddenly for the period
    of three-quarters of an hour.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

  <p>As another example of the disturbance of water at the time of a great
    earthquake in districts where the earthquake was not felt, may be
    mentioned the swelling of the waters of the Marañon, in 1746, on the
    night when Callao was overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>Sudden variations in the level of the water have been many times
    observed in the North American lakes. The changes in level which
    sometimes take place in the Genfer and Boden lakes are supposed to have
    some relation to the condition of the atmosphere. A rising and falling
    of especial note took place on April 18, 1855.</p>

  <p>In Switzerland these sudden changes are known as ‘seiches’ or ‘rhussen.’</p>

  <p>From the observations and calculations of Prof. Forel it would seem
    that the period of the ‘seiches’ depends upon the dimensions of the
    lakes; the calculated periods dependent on the depths of the lakes
    being approximately equal to the observed periods.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

  <p>W. T. Bingham, writing on the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands,
    remarks that it is not unusual for the sea to be agitated by great and
    unusual tides, and that such sea waves have not been attended with
    volcanic eruptions or seismic disturbances. Thus in May 1819 the tide
    rose and fell thirteen times. On November 7, 1837, there was an ebb and
    flow of eight feet every twenty-eight minutes. Again, on May 17, 1841,
    like phenomena, unaccompanied by any other unusual occurrences, were
    recorded.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

  <p>Phenomena which may possibly hold a relationship to earth pulsations
    are the periodical swellings of the ocean on the coast of Peru. Dr. C.
    F. Winslow, who made a long <span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
    period observation upon the coast of Peru,
    found ‘the highest tides to prevail at Callao and Paita in December
    and January,’ and ‘also a series of enormous waves or sea-swells to
    be thrown from time to time upon the coast, varying from twenty-four
    to twenty-seven hours in continuance, accompanied by unusual height
    of the tide during the same period.’ During June and July the ocean
    was unusually tranquil. These phenomena do not appear to be connected
    with great atmospheric storms, nor do they hold any relation to the
    prevailing wind. They increase with and accompany the swelling of the
    tides, and occur generally, but not always, about full moon.</p>

  <p>Sometimes they break suddenly upon the coast. ‘<em>They are annual and
    constant in their periodicity.</em>’</p>

  <p>The periodical swellings are most noticeable between Tumbez 3° S.L. and
    the Chincha Islands 14° S.L.</p>

  <p>These oceanic phenomena synchronise with the periodic intensity of
    earthquake phenomena in that part of the globe, and these with tidal
    movements.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

  <p><em>Other phenomena possibly attributable to earth pulsations.</em>—If we
    assume that earth pulsations have an existence, these many phenomena
    which are otherwise difficult to understand meet with an explanation.
    The curious effects which were produced in the springs at Toplitz at
    the time of the Lisbon earthquake may have been due to a pulse-like
    wave. The flow of the principal spring was greatly increased. Before
    the increase it became turbid and at one time stopped. Subsequently it
    became clear and flowed as usual, but the water was hotter and more
    strongly mineralised. Sudden changes in the flow of underground waters
    which from time to time are observed may be attributed to like causes.
    Secondary earthquakes such as occurred after the Lisbon
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>earthquake,
    as for instance in Derbyshire, may have been produced by pulsations
    disturbing the equilibrium of ground in a critical state.</p>

  <p>The falling in of subterranean excavations is also possibly connected
    with these phenomena.</p>

  <p><em>Possible causes of earth pulsations.</em>—Mr. George Darwin, in a report
    to the British Association (1882), has shown that movements of
    considerable magnitude may occur in the earth’s crust in consequence of
    fluctuations in barometrical pressure. (A rise of the barometer over an
    area is equivalent to loading that area with a weight, in consequence
    of which it is depressed. When the barometer falls, the load is removed
    from the area, which, in virtue of its elasticity, rises to its
    original position. This fall and rise of the ground completes a single
    pulsation.)</p>

  <p>On the assumption that the earth has a rigidity like steel, Mr. Darwin
    calculates that if the barometer rises an inch over an area like
    Australia, the load is sufficient to sink that continent two or three
    inches.</p>

  <p>The tides which twice a day load our shores cause the land to rise and
    fall in a similar manner. On the shores of the Atlantic, Mr. Darwin
    has calculated that this rise and fall of the land may be as much as 5
    inches. By these risings and fallings of the land the inclination of
    the surface is so altered that the stile of a plummet suspended from a
    rigid support ought not always to hang over the same spot. There would
    be a deflection of the vertical.</p>

  <p>In short, calculations respecting the effects of loads of various
    descriptions, which we know are by natural operations continually
    being placed upon and removed from the surface of various areas of the
    earth’s surface, indicate that slow pulsatory movements of the earth’s
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
    surface must be taking place, causing variations in inclination of one
    portion of the earth’s crust relatively to another.</p>

  <p>Although it is possible that phenomena like the surging of levels may
    be attributable to causes like these, we can hardly attribute the other
    phenomena to such agencies.</p>

  <p>Rather than seek an explanation from agencies exogenous to our earth,
    we might perhaps with advantage appeal to the endogenous phenomena of
    our planet. When the barometer falls, which we have shown corresponds
    to an upward motion of the earth’s crust, we know, from the results of
    experiments, that microseismic motions are particularly noticeable.</p>

  <p>As a pictorial illustration of what this really means, we may imagine
    ourselves to be residing on the loosely fitting lid of a large
    cauldron, the relief of the external pressure over which increases the
    activity of its internal ebullition—the jars attendant on which are
    gradually propagated from their endogenous source to the exterior of
    our planet. This travelling outwards would take place much in the same
    way that the vibrations consequent to the rattle and jar of a large
    factory slowly spread themselves farther and farther from the point
    where they were produced.</p>

  <p>Admitting an action of this description to take place, it would then
    follow that this extra liberation of gaseous material beneath the
    earth’s crust would result in an increased upward pressure from within,
    and a tendency on the part of the earth’s crust to elevation. If we
    accept this as an explanation of the increased activity of a tremor
    indicator, then such an instrument may be regarded as a barometer,
    measuring by its motions the variations in the internal pressure of our
    planet.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

  <p>The relief of external pressure and the increase of internal pressure,
    it will be observed, both tend in the same direction—namely, to an
    elevation of the earth’s crust.</p>

  <p>This explanation of the increased activity of earth tremors, which
    has also been suggested by M. S. di Rossi, is here only advanced as a
    speculation, more probable perhaps than many others.</p>

  <p>We know how a mass of sulphur which has been fused in the presence of
    water in a closed boiler gives up in the form of steam the occluded
    moisture upon the relief of pressure. In a similar manner we see steam
    escaping from volcanic vents and cooling streams of lava. We also
    know how gas escapes from the pores and cavities in a seam of coal
    on the fall of the barometrical column. We also know that certain
    wells increase the height of their column under like conditions. The
    latter of these phenomena, resulting in an increase in the rate of
    drainage of an area by its tendency to render such an area of less
    weight, facilitates its rise. If we follow the views of Mr. Mallet in
    considering that the pressures exerted on the crust of our earth may in
    volcanic regions be roughly estimated by the height of a column of lava
    in the volcanoes of such districts, we see that in the neighbourhood of
    a volcano like Cotopaxi the upward pressures must be enormously great.
    Further, the phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes indicate that these
    pressures are variable. Before a volcano bursts forth we should expect
    that there would be in its vicinity an upward bulging of the crust, and
    after its formation a fall. Further, it is not difficult to conjecture
    other possible means by which such pressures may obtain relief.</p>

  <p>Should these pressures then find relief without rupturing the
    surface, it is not difficult to imagine them as the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span> originators of
    vast pulsations which may be recorded on the surface of the earth as
    wave-like motions of slow period.</p>

  <p>As an explanation of the strange movements observed on seas and lakes,
    Kluge brings forward the following strange and remarkable theory. The
    oxygen of the air is magnetic, whilst water is diamagnetic and the
    earth magnetic: we have, therefore, in our seas and lakes a diamagnetic
    body lying between and being, consequently, repelled from two magnetic
    bodies. By variation in temperature, the balance of repulsions
    exerted by the air and the earth is destroyed. Thus, by an elevation
    of temperature the air expands and flows away from the heated area,
    where, in consequence, there is less oxygen. The result of this is,
    that the repulsion of the air upon the waters is less than that of the
    earth upon the waters, and the waters are in consequence raised up. By
    a falling of temperature the waters may be depressed, and by either
    of these actions waves may be produced without the intervention of
    earthquakes or earth pulsations.</p>

  <p>The more definite kinds of information which we have to bring forward,
    tending to prove the existence of earth pulsations, too slow in period
    to be experienced by ordinary observers, are those which appear to be
    resultant phenomena of great earthquakes.</p>

  <p>The phenomena that we are certain of in connection with earth
    vibrations, whether these vibrations are produced artificially by
    explosions of dynamite in bore-holes, or whether they are produced
    naturally by earthquakes, are, first, that a disturbance as it dies out
    at a given point often shows in the diagrams obtained by seismographs a
    decrease in period; and, secondly, a similar decrease in the period of
    the disturbance takes place as the disturbance spreads.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

  <p>As examples of these actions I will quote the following.</p>

  <p>The diagram of the disturbance of March 1, 1882, taken at Yokohama,
    shows that the vibrations at the commencement of the disturbance had a
    period of about three per second, near the middle of the disturbance
    the period is about 1·1, whilst near the end the period has decreased
    to ·46. That is to say, the backward and forward motion of the ground
    at the commencement of the earthquake was six times as great as it was
    near the end, when to make one complete oscillation it took between two
    and three seconds. Probably the period became still less, but was not
    recorded owing to the insensibility of the instruments to such slow
    motions.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

  <p>We have not yet the means of comparing together diagrams of two or more
    earthquakes, one having been taken near to the origin, and the other
    at a distance. The only comparisons which I have been enabled to make
    have been those of diagrams taken of the same earthquake, one in Tokio
    and the other in Yokohama. As this base is only sixteen miles, and the
    earthquake may have originated at a distance of several hundreds of
    miles, comparisons like these can be of but little value.</p>

  <p>Other diagrams illustrating the same point are those obtained at three
    stations in a straight line, but at different distances from the
    origin of a disturbance produced by exploding a charge of dynamite in
    a bore-hole. A simple inspection of these diagrams shows that at the
    near station the disturbance consisted of backward and forward motions,
    which, as compared with the same disturbance as recorded at a more
    distant station, were very rapid. Further, by examining the diagram
    of the motions, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
    say, at the near station, it is clearly evident that
    the period of the backward and forward motion rapidly decreased as the
    motion died out.</p>

  <p>These illustrations are given as examples out of a large series of
    other records, all showing like results.</p>

  <p>An observation which confirms the records obtained from seismographs
    respecting the increase in period of an earthquake as it dies out
    I have had opportunities of twice making with my levels. After all
    perceptible motion of the ground subsequent upon a moderately severe
    shock had died away, I have distinctly seen the bubble in one of these
    levels slowly pulsating with an irregular period of from one to five
    seconds.</p>

  <p>Although we must draw a distinction between earth waves and water
    waves, we yet see that in these points they present a striking
    likeness. Let us take, for example, any of the large earthquake waves
    which have originated off the coast of South America, and then radiated
    outwards, until they spread across the Pacific, to be recorded in Japan
    and other countries perhaps twenty-five hours afterwards, at a distance
    of nearly 9,000 miles from their origin. Near this origin they appeared
    as walls of water which were seen rapidly advancing towards the coast.
    These have been from twenty to two hundred feet in height, and they
    succeeded each other at rapid intervals, until finally they died out as
    a series of gentle waves. By the time these walls of water traversed
    the Pacific, to, let us say, Japan, they broadened out to a swell so
    flat that it could not be detected on the smoothest water excepting
    along shore lines where the water rose and fell like the tide. Instead
    of a wall of water sixty feet in height, we had long flat undulations
    perhaps eight feet in height, but with a distance from crest to crest
    of from one to two hundred miles.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

  <p>If we turn to the effects of large earthquakes as exhibited on the
    land, I think that we shall find records of phenomena which are only
    to be explained on the assumption of an action having taken place
    analogous to that which takes place so often in the ocean, or an action
    similar to that exhibited by small earthquakes, and artificially
    produced disturbances, if greatly exaggerated.</p>

  <p>The only explanation for the phenomena accompanying the Lisbon
    earthquake appears to be that the short quick vibrations which had
    ruined so many cities in Portugal had, by the time that they had
    radiated to distant countries, gradually become changed into long flat
    waves having a period of perhaps several minutes. In countries like
    England these pulse-like movements were too gentle to be perceived,
    except in the effects produced by tipping up the beds of lakes and
    ponds.</p>

  <p>The phenomenon was not unlike that of a swell produced by a distant
    storm. It would seem possible that in some cases pulsations producing
    phenomena like the ‘seiches’ of Switzerland might have their origin
    beneath the ocean, or deep down beneath the earth’s crust. Perhaps,
    instead of commencing with the ‘snap and jar’ of an earthquake, they
    may commence as a heaving or sinking of a considerable area, which
    may be regarded as an uncompleted effort in the establishment of an
    earthquake or a volcano.</p>

  <p>From what has now been said it would seem that earth pulsations
    are phenomena with a real existence, and that some of these are
    attributable to earthquakes. On the other hand, certain earthquakes are
    attributable to earth pulsations. Some of the phenomena which have been
    brought forward have only a possible connection with these movements,
    and they yet require investigation.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> Elastic tides in the earth’s
    crust have for long been realities in the minds of physicists. These,
    however, are due to lunar and solar influences, and are regular in
    their action. The tidal-like movements called pulsations are of greater
    magnitude, and their goings and comings are irregular.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="summary">
    Evidences of oscillation—Examples of oscillation—Temple of Jupiter
    Serapis—Observations of Darwin—Causes of oscillation.</div>

  <p><em>Evidences of oscillation.</em>—By earth oscillations are meant those slow
    and quiet changes in the relative level of the sea and land which
    geologists speak of as elevations or subsidences. These movements are
    especially characteristic of volcanic and earthquake-shaken countries.</p>

  <p>As evidences of elevations we appeal to phenomena like raised beaches,
    sea-worn caves, raised coral reefs, and the remains of other dead
    organisms like barnacles, and the borings of lithodomous shells in and
    on the rocks of many coasts high above the level of the highest tides.
    As a proof that subsidence has taken place, there is the evidence
    afforded by submerged forests, the prolongation of certain valleys
    beneath the bed of the ocean, the formation of coral islands, the
    peculiar distribution of the plants and animals which we find in many
    countries, and the submergence of works of human construction. Inasmuch
    as these phenomena are discussed so fully in many treatises on physical
    geology, the references to them here will be made as brief as possible.
    Elevations and depressions which have taken place at the time of large
    earthquakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
    in a paroxysmal manner have already been mentioned. The
    movements referred to in this chapter, although generally taking place
    with extreme slowness, in certain instances, by an increase in their
    rapidity, have approached in character to earth pulsations. In most
    instances it would appear that the upward movement of the ground, which
    may be likened to a process of tumefaction, goes on so gently that it
    only becomes appreciable after the lapse of many generations.</p>

  <p><em>Examples of movements.</em>—Lyell estimated that the average rate of rise
    in Scandinavia has been about two and a half feet per century. At the
    North Cape the rise may have been as much as five or six feet per
    century. Observations made at the temple of Jupiter Serapis, between
    October 1822 and July 1838, showed that the ground was sinking at the
    rate of about one inch in four years. Since the Roman period, when this
    temple was built, the ground has sunk twenty feet below the waves. Now
    the floor of the temple is on the level of the sea. Lyell remarks that
    if we reflect on the dates of the principal oscillations at this place
    there appears to be connection between the movements of upheaval and a
    local development of volcanic heat, whilst periods of depression are
    concurrent with periods of volcanic quiescence.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

  <p>As examples of movements even more rapid than those at the Temple of
    Jupiter Serapis we refer to an account of the earthquakes in Vallais
    (November 1755), when the ground about a mountain at a small distance
    from Brigue sank about a thumb’s-breadth every twenty-four hours. This
    took place between December 9 and February 26.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

  <p>Another remarkable example of earth movement is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>given in the account
    of the earthquake at Scarborough, on December 29, 1737, when the head
    of the spa water well was forced up in the air about ten yards high. At
    this time the sands on the shore are said to have risen so slowly that
    people came out to watch them.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

  <p>Two other examples of rapid earth movement are taken from Professor
    Rossi’s ‘Meteorologia Endogena.’ Professor D. Seghetti, writing to
    Professor Rossi, says that a few lustres ago (one lustre = twenty
    years) Mount S. Giovanni hid the towns Jenne and Subiaco from each
    other. From Subiaco the church at Jenne is now visible, which a few
    years ago was invisible. The people at Jenne also can see more than
    formerly. The supposition is that the side of Mount S. Giovanni is
    lowered. This fact corresponds to a fact stated by Professor Carina,
    who says that forty or fifty years ago from Granaiola you could not see
    either the church of S. Maria Assunta di Citrone or the church of S.
    Pietro di Corsena. Now you can see both.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

  <p>For a remarkable example illustrating the connection between seismic
    activity and elevation we are indebted to the patient labours of
    Darwin, who carefully investigated the evidences of elevation which
    are visible upon the western coasts of South America. These evidences,
    consisting of marks of erosion, caves, ancient beaches, sand dunes,
    terraces of gravel, &amp;c., were traced between latitudes 45° 35′ to 12°
    5′, a distance north and south of 2,075 geographical miles, and there
    is but little doubt that they extend much farther. As deduced from
    observations upon upraised shells alone, a summary of Mr. Darwin’s
    observations are contained in the following table:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

  </table>

  <p>Shells, similar to those clinging to uplifted rocks, which are
    evidences of these elevations, still exist in the neighbouring seas,
    and in the same proportionate numbers as they are found in the upraised
    beds. In addition to this, Mr. Darwin shows us that at Lima, during the
    Indo-human period, the elevation has been at least eighty-five feet.
    At Valparaiso, during the last 220 years, the rise was about nineteen
    feet, and in the seventeen years subsequent to 1817 the rise has been
    ten or eleven feet, a portion only of which can be attributed to
    earthquakes. In 1834 the rise there was apparently still in progress.</p>

  <p>At Chiloe there has been a gradual elevation of about four feet in four
    years. These, together with numerous other examples, testify to the
    gradual but, as compared with other parts of the globe, exceedingly
    rapid rise of the ground upon the western shores of South America.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
    The most important point to be noticed is that this district of rapid
    elevation is one of the most earthquake-shaken regions of the world.
    And further, judging from Darwin’s remarks, in those portions of it
    where the movements have been the most extensive, and at the same time
    probably the most rapid, the seismic disturbances appear to have been
    the most noticeable.</p>

  <p>Similar remarks may be applied to Japan, it being in those districts
    where evidences of recent elevation are abundant that earthquakes
    are numerous. Thus, in the bay of Yedo, where we have borings of
    lithodomi in the tufaceous cliffs ten feet above high-water mark,
    which, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
    inasmuch as the rock in which they are found is soft and easily
    weathered, indicate an exceedingly rapid elevation, earthquakes are of
    common occurrence.</p>

  <p>From the evidences of elevation which we have upon the South American
    coast, Japan, and in other countries, it appears that these movements
    are intermittent, there being periods of rest, when sea cliffs are
    denuded, and perhaps even periods of subsidence. There is also evidence
    to show that, although these movements have been gradual from time to
    time, they have been aided by starts occasioned by earthquakes.</p>

  <p>As to whether earthquakes are more numerous during periods of
    elevation, or of subsidence, or during the intermediate periods of
    rest, we have no evidence.</p>

  <p>Sudden displacements which occasionally accompany earthquakes might, it
    was said, sometimes be regarded as the <em>cause</em> of an earthquake, and
    sometimes as the <em>effect</em>.</p>

  <p>The slow elevations here referred to may be looked upon as being one of
    the more important factors in the production of earthquakes. By various
    causes the rocky coast is bent until, having reached the limit of its
    elasticity, it snaps, and, in flying back like a broken spring, causes
    the jars and tremors of an earthquake.</p>

  <p>If this is the case, then the number of earthquakes felt in a district
    which is being elevated may possibly be a function of the rate of
    elevation.</p>

      David Milne says that ‘out of 110 shocks recorded in
      England, thirty-one originated in Wales, thirty-one along the south
      coast of England, fourteen on the borders of Yorkshire and Derbyshire,
      and five or six in Cumberland.’

      A notable example of a rapid diminution in the number of
      earthquakes felt at a place is that of Comrie in Scotland. In 1839–40,
      no less than sixty shocks were felt in eleven months. In 1842–43, about
      thirty shocks were felt, and in the following year thirty-seven. Since
      this time the number of shocks has decreased until they are almost of
      as rare occurrence at Comrie as in other portions of the British Isles.

  <p class="center"><b>By J. W. JUDD</b>,<br />
    <span class="small">Professor of Geology in the Royal School of Mines (London).</span></p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="center">With Ninety-six Illustrations. 12mo. Cloth, $2.00.</p>
  <hr class="r15" />

  <p>“The volume before us is one of the pleasantest science manuals we have
    read for some time.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

  <p>“Mr. Judd’s summary is so full and so concise, that it is almost
    impossible to give a fair idea in a short review.”—<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>“Professor Judd discusses the nature of volcanic action, the internal
    structure of volcanic mountains, the distribution of volcanoes upon
    the surface of the globe, their activity in different periods of the
    earth’s existence, the use of volcanoes in the economy of nature, the
    various theories that have been made to explain volcanic action. He has
    abbreviated in this volume a vast amount of information, which has a
    fascinating interest for many minds by reason of its relation to the
    past history and future destiny of this little bubble of earth upon
    which we sail through the infinite spaces of ether.”—<i>New York Home
      Journal.</i></p>

  <p>“The book gives an exhaustive statement of the phenomena of volcanoes,
    and of the facts in the formation of mountain-chains, and relates a
    mass of interesting observations and facts, the results of patient and
    extensive personal investigation and study, mostly in different places
    in Southern Europe, but not neglecting the world’s larger volcanoes in
    other regions.”—<i>Hartford Times.</i></p>

  <p>“A fascinating example of patient observation, sound judgment, and
    acute reasoning. Under Professor Judd’s skillful treatment the volcano
    is forced not only to tell its own history, but also to solve a number
    of earth problems seemingly disconnected with it; and the story is
    told in strong, nervous language, and with an earnestness and subdued
    enthusiasm that are delightfully stimulating.”—<i>Boston Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>“Professor Judd first points out the errors in the old definition of
    a volcano. The volcanic hole is very often not on the summit, but
    on the side, sometimes at the base of the mountain or hill, and it
    sends forth steam rather than smoke, and the supposed raging flames
    are nothing more than the glowing light of a mass of molten material
    reflected from those vapor-clouds. So our old ignorance vanishes, and
    in this admirable work the internal structure of volcanic mountains,
    the nature and products of volcanic action, and the distribution of the
    materials rejected from volcanic vents, the succession of operations
    taking place at volcanic centers, are all very ably and clearly
    discussed.”—<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>

  <p>“A succinct and excellent treatise on a very interesting
    subject.”—<i>Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

  <p class="center"><b>By J. B. STALLO.</b></p>

  <hr class="r15" />
  <p class="center">12mo, cloth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $1.75.</p>

  <hr class="r15" />

  <p>“Judge Stallo’s work is an inquiry into the validity of those
    mechanical conceptions of the universe which are now held as
    fundamental in physical science. He takes up the leading modern
    doctrines which are based upon this mechanical conception, such as
    the atomic constitution of matter, the kinetic theory of gases, the
    conservation of energy, the nebular hypothesis, and other views, to
    find how much stands upon solid empirical ground, and how much rests
    upon metaphysical speculation. Since the appearance of Dr. Draper’s
    ‘Religion and Science,’ no book has been published in the country
    calculated to make so deep an impression on thoughtful and educated
    readers as this volume.... The range and minuteness of the author’s
    learning, the acuteness of his reasoning, and the singular precision
    and clearness of his style, are qualities which very seldom have been
    jointly exhibited in a scientific treatise.”—<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

  <p>“Judge J. B. Stallo, of Cincinnati, is a German by birth, and came to
    this country at about the age of seventeen. He was early familiar with
    science, and he lectured for some years in an Eastern college; but
    at length he adopted the profession of law. He is also remembered by
    many as an author, having a number of years ago written a metaphysical
    treatise of marked ability for one of his youthful years. His present
    book must be read deliberately, must be studied to be appreciated; but
    the students of science, as well as those of metaphysics, are certain
    to be deeply interested in its logical developments. It is a timely and
    telling contribution to the philosophy of science, imperatively called
    for by the present exigencies in the progress of knowledge. It is to be
    commended equally for the solid value of its contents and the scholarly
    finish of its execution.”—<i>The Popular Science Monthly.</i></p>

  <p>“The book is of vital interest to a much larger class than
    specialists—to all, in fact, who value clear thinking or are interested
    in the accuracy more than the progress of scientific thought. It deals
    with the results and theories of physical science, and in no sense
    with the processes of the laboratory. It is written with a clearness
    that is uncommon in philosophic works and with a desire to find truth,
    conscious of the fact that a prime prerequisite of finding it is to
    clear the way of accumulated and fast-settling untruths. It is a
    scientific rebuke, as severe as it is lucid, of the scientists who
    leave their apparatus and go star-gazing: here is the pit into which
    they have fallen.”—<i>New York World.</i></p>

  <p>“The volume is an important contribution to scientific discussion,
    and is marked by closeness of reasoning, and clearness and cogency of
    statement.”—<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>
